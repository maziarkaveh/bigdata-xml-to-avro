Hadoop project to convert xml to avro
There are several challenges you will face when developing Hadoop applications. The first challenge is the installation of a Hadoop cluster. The second challenge is a way to use your data directly into a mapper or reducer as a data object. In the implementation of Hadoop available today, it is possible to use the structured format XML like Avro format, developed by Apache. Although avro is a good format for structured data, it has not been possible to use the more common XML format as objects in Hadoop. Our compact framework gives the user a possibility to import XML 
directly into Hadoop and convert it to objects for the MapReduce functions. This paper describes the process.
