An '''aircraft''' is a machine that is able to [[flight|fly]] by gaining support from the [[air]], or, in general, the [[atmosphere]] of a planet.&lt;!--English word &quot;aircraft&quot; is singular and plural with no &quot;s&quot;. See also the link to Wiktionary below.--&gt; It counters the force of gravity by using either [[Buoyancy|static lift]] or by using the [[Lift (force)|dynamic lift]] of an [[airfoil]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft dictionary.com definition of aircraft]&lt;/ref&gt; or in a few cases the [[Powered lift|downward thrust]] from [[jet engines]]. 

The [[human]] activity that surrounds aircraft is called ''[[aviation]]''. [[Aircrew|Crewed]] aircraft are flown by an onboard [[aviator|pilot]], but [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s may be [[remotely piloted vehicle|remotely controlled]] or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, propulsion, usage and others.

==History==
{{Main|Aviation history}}
{{See also|Timeline of aviation}}

Flying model craft and stories of manned flight go back many centuries, however the first manned ascent – and safe descent – in modern times took place by hot-air balloon in the 18th century. Each of the two World Wars led to great technical advances. Consequently the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras:
*[[List of early flying machines|Pioneers of flight]], from the [[Early flying machines|earliest experiments]] to 1913.
*[[Aviation in World War I|First World War]], 1914 to 1918.
*Inter-war, sometimes called the [[Golden Age of Aviation|Golden Age]], 1919 to 1938.
*[[Air warfare of World War II|Second World War]], 1939 to 1945.
*[[Post-war|Postwar era]], also called the [[jet age]], 1946 to the present day.

==Methods of lift==

===Lighter than air – aerostats{{Anchor|Lighter than air}}===
[[File:Ballooning trip Morocco.JPG|thumb|A hot air [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] in flight]]
{{Main|Aerostat}}

[[Aerostat]]s use [[buoyancy]] to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large gasbags or canopies, filled with a relatively low-density gas such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]], or [[hot air balloon|hot air]], which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure, it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces.

Small hot-air balloons called [[Kongming lantern|sky lanterns]] date back to the 3rd century BC, and were only the second type of aircraft to fly, the first being [[kite]]s.

A [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] was originally any aerostat, while the term [[airship]] was used for large, powered aircraft designs – usually fixed-wing{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – though none had yet been built. The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a [[rigid airship|rigid]] outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the [[Zeppelin]]s being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so &quot;airship&quot; came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the [[Hindenburg disaster]] in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a &quot;balloon&quot; is an unpowered aerostat, whilst an &quot;airship&quot; is a powered one.

A powered, steerable aerostat is called a ''[[dirigible]]''. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes ''dirigible balloon'' is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as ''[[non-rigid airship|blimps]]''. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname ''blimp'' was adopted along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.

===Heavier than air – aerodynes{{Anchor|Heavier than air}}===
&lt;!-- Note: there are links to this section from other articles --&gt;
Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as [[airplane]]s, must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term ''aerodyne''. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust: [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic lift]], and [[powered lift]] in the form of engine thrust.

Aerodynamic lift involving [[wing]]s is the most common, with [[fixed-wing aircraft]] being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and [[rotorcraft]] by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]]. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate [[Lift (force)|lift]]. A ''flexible wing'' is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A ''[[kite]]'' is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.

With powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust [[vertical direction|vertically]] downward.  [[V/STOL]] aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] and [[F-35_Lightning_II#F-35B|F-35B]] take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.

A pure [[rocket]] is not usually regarded as an aerodyne, because it does not depend on the air for its lift (and can even fly into space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.

====Fixed-wing====
[[File:Collection of military aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]] test aircraft]]

  {{legend|#a4b8e8|[[Boeing 747-8]]}} (longest passenger aircraft)
]]

{{main|fixed-wing aircraft}}

The forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the [[kite]]. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the [[wind]] blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly, and [[History of science and technology in China|were invented in China]] around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, wind tunnels, and computer modelling programs became available.

The first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were [[unpowered aircraft|gliders]].  A [[glider aircraft|glider]] designed by [[George Cayley|Cayley]] carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853.

Practical, powered, fixed-wing aircraft (the aeroplane or airplane) were invented by Wilbur and Orville Wright. Besides the method of [[#Propulsion|propulsion]], fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their [[wing configuration]]. The most important wing characteristics are:
*Number of wings – [[Monoplane]], [[biplane]], etc.
*Wing support – Braced or cantilever, rigid, or flexible.
*Wing planform – including [[aspect ratio]], angle of [[swept wing|sweep]], and any variations along the span (including the important class of [[delta wing]]s).
*Location of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.
*[[Dihedral (aircraft)|Dihedral angle]] – positive, zero, or negative (anhedral).

A [[Wing configuration#Variable geometry|variable geometry]] aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.

A ''[[flying wing]]'' has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a ''[[lifting body]]'', which has no wings, though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.

[[wing-In-Ground effect vehicle|Wing-in-ground-effect]] vehicles may be considered as fixed-wing aircraft.  They &quot;fly&quot; efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoff. An example is the Russian [[ekranoplan]] (nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot;). [[Human-powered flight|Man-powered aircraft]] also rely on [[ground effect in aircraft|ground effect]] to remain airborne with a minimal pilot power, but this is only because they are so underpowered — in fact, the airframe is capable of flying higher.

====Rotorcraft====
[[File:20100627 Xenon2 Krakow 1328.jpg|thumb|An autogyro]]
{{Main|Rotorcraft}}

Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil section blades (a ''rotary wing'') to provide lift. Types include [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s, and various hybrids such as [[gyrodyne]]s and compound rotorcraft.

''[[Helicopter]]s'' have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, producing thrust for forward flight. Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips.

''[[Autogyro]]s'' have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. [[Rotor kite]]s are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.

''Compound rotorcraft'' have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. They are nowadays classified as ''[[powered lift]]'' types and not as rotorcraft. ''[[Tiltrotor]]'' aircraft (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]), [[tiltwing]], [[tailsitter]], and [[coleopter]] aircraft have their rotors/[[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]] horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.

====Other methods of lift====
[[File:X24B.jpg|thumb|X-24B lifting body, specialized [[glider aircraft|glider]]]]

*A ''[[lifting body]]'' is an aircraft body shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they are too small to provide significant lift and are used only for stability and control. Lifting bodies are not efficient: they suffer from high drag, and must also travel at high speed to generate enough lift to fly. Many of the research prototypes, such as the [[Martin-Marietta X-24]], which led up to the [[Space Shuttle]], were lifting bodies (though the shuttle itself is not), and some [[supersonic]] [[missile]]s obtain lift from the airflow over a tubular body.
*''[[Powered lift]]'' types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoff and landing ([[VTOL]]). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of powered lift types include [[VTOL]] jet aircraft (such as the [[Harrier jump-jet]]) and [[tiltrotors]] (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]), among others.&lt;!-- A few examples rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift throughout the whole flight. There are few practical applications. Experimental designs have been built for personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks or for [[VTOL]] research (for example the [[flying Bedstead|flying bedstead]]).--&gt;

==Propulsion==

===Unpowered aircraft===
{{Main|Unpowered aircraft}}
[[Glider (aircraft)|Gliders]] are heavier-than-air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered &quot;tug&quot; aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can 'soar' – gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer [[George Cayley]], whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dee |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Dee |coauthors= |title= The Man who Discovered Flight: George Cayley and the First Airplane |year= 2007|publisher= McClelland and Stewart|location= Toronto |isbn= 978-0-7710-2971-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of gliders are [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]], [[hang glider]]s and [[paraglider]]s. 

[[Balloon (aircraft)|Balloons]] drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude, either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude). A wing-shaped hybrid balloon can glide directionally when rising or falling; but a spherically shaped balloon does not have such directional control.

[[Kite]]s are aircraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/guided.htm NASA's Beginners Guide to Aeronautics]&lt;/ref&gt; that are tethered to the ground or other object (fixed or mobile) that maintains tension in the tether or [[kite line]]; they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. [[Kytoon]]s are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.

===Powered aircraft===
{{main|Powered aircraft}}
Powered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically [[aircraft engine]]s although rubber and manpower have also been used.  Most aircraft engines are either lightweight [[piston engine]]s or [[gas turbine]]s.  Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional [[fuel tank]]s in the [[fuselage]].

====Propeller aircraft====
[[File:WestCoastAirFloatplane.jpg|thumb|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHavilland Twin Otter]] adapted as a [[Seaplane|floatplane]]]]

[[Propeller aircraft]] use one or more [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]] (airscrews) to create thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in ''[[tractor configuration]]'' but can be mounted behind in ''[[pusher configuration]]''. Variations of propeller layout include ''[[contra-rotating propellers]]'' and ''[[ducted fan]]s''.

Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers.  Early airships used man power or [[steam aircraft|steam engines]]. The more practical [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until [[World War II]] and is still used in many smaller aircraft. Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a [[turboprop]] or [[propfan]]. [[Human-powered flight]] has been achieved, but has not become a practical means of transport. Unmanned aircraft and models have also used power sources such as [[Electric aircraft|electric motors]] and rubber bands.

====Jet aircraft====
[[File:Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor JSOH.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor]]

[[Jet aircraft]] use [[airbreathing jet engine]]s which take in air, burn fuel with it in a [[combustion chamber]], and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.

[[Turbojet]] and [[turbofan]] engines use a spinning turbine to drive one or more fans, which provide additional thrust. An [[afterburner]] may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust, especially on military &quot;fast jets&quot;. Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the [[pulse jet engine|pulse jet]] and [[ramjet]]. These mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed by some other method. Other variants have also been used, including the [[motorjet]] and hybrids such as the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney J58]], which can convert between turbojet and ramjet operation.

Compared to propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, greater efficiency.&lt;ref name=hist8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm |title=ch10-3 |publisher=Hq.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also much more fuel-efficient than [[rocket]]s.  As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.

====Rotorcraft====
Some [[rotorcraft]], such as [[helicopter]]s, have a powered rotary wing or ''rotor'', where the rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards. The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used [[Tip jet|jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips]].

====Other types of powered aircraft====
*''[[Rocket-powered aircraft]]'' have occasionally been experimented with, and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Messerschmitt ''Komet'']] fighter even saw action in the Second World War. Since then, they have been restricted to research aircraft, such as the [[North American X-15]], which traveled up into space where air-breathing engines cannot work (rockets carry their own oxidant). Rockets have more often been used as a supplement to the main power plant, typically for the [[rocket-assisted take off]] of heavily loaded aircraft, but also to provide high-speed dash capability in some hybrid designs such as the [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]].
*The ''[[ornithopter]]'' obtains thrust by flapping its wings. It has found practical use in a [[Ornithopter#Recent developments|model hawk]] used to freeze prey animals into stillness so that they can be captured, and in toy birds.

==Design and construction==
Aircraft are [[aircraft design process|designed]] according to many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, [[air safety|safety]] protocols and physical and economic constraints. For many types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities.

The key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:
*The ''structure'' comprises the main load-bearing elements and associated equipment.
*The ''propulsion system'' (if it is powered) comprises the power source and associated equipment, as described above.
*The ''avionics'' comprise the control, navigation and communication systems, usually electrical in nature.

===Structure===
The approach to structural design varies widely between different types of aircraft. Some, such as [[paraglider]]s, comprise only flexible materials which act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape. A [[balloon]] similarly relies on internal gas pressure but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload. Early aircraft, including [[airship]]s, often employed flexible [[aircraft dope|doped]] [[aircraft fabric covering]] to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame. Later aircraft employed semi-[[monocoque]] techniques, where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads. In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.

The key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.

====Aerostats====
Lighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags, typically with a supporting structure of flexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull. Other elements such as engines or a gondola may also be attached to the supporting structure.
{{Main|Aerostat}}

====Aerodynes====
[[File:Merlin Airframe Material.jpg|thumb|Airframe diagram for an [[AgustaWestland AW101]] [[helicopter]]]]
Heavier-than-air types are characterised by one or more wings and a central [[fuselage]]. The fuselage typically also carries a tail or [[empennage]] for stability and control, and an undercarriage for takeoff and landing. Engines may be located on the fuselage or wings. On a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] the wings are rigidly attached to the fuselage, while on a [[rotorcraft]] the wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft. Smaller designs sometimes use flexible materials for part or all of the structure, held in place either by a rigid frame or by air pressure. The fixed parts of the structure comprise the [[airframe]].

===Avionics===
{{Main|Avionics}}
The avionics comprise the [[flight control system]]s and related equipment, including the [[cockpit]] instrumentation, navigation, [[radar]], monitoring, and [[communication system]]s.

==Flight characteristics==

===Flight envelope===
{{main|Flight envelope}}
The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its capabilities in terms of [[airspeed]] and [[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] or altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?type=simple;c=ecfr;cc=ecfr;sid=a8f38006e777ba46ba8000f7c2fe6641;region=DIV1;q1=23.335;rgn=div8;view=text;idno=14;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.10.3.70.8 §23.333 Flight envelope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf Flight envelope – diagram]&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a craft is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown &quot;outside the envelope&quot;, something considered unsafe.

===Range===
[[File:Boeing 777-200LR banking over mountain.jpg|thumb|The [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] is the longest-range airliner, capable of flights of more than halfway around the world.]]
{{main|range (aircraft)}}
The range is the distance an aircraft can fly between [[takeoff]] and [[landing]], as limited by the time it can remain airborne.

For a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by the fuel load and rate of consumption.

For an unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is limited by factors such as weather conditions and pilot endurance. Many aircraft types are restricted to daylight hours, while balloons are limited by their supply of lifting gas. The range can be seen as the average ground speed multiplied by the maximum time in the air.

===Flight dynamics===
{{main|Flight dynamics (aircraft)}}
[[File:Flight dynamics with text.png|right|200px]]
'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] around [[Aircraft axis|three axes]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'', and ''yaw'' (quite different from their use as [[Tait-Bryan angles]]).

*Roll is a rotation about the longitudinal axis (equivalent to the rolling or [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] of a ship) giving an up-down movement of the wing tips measured by the roll or bank angle.

*Pitch is a rotation about the sideways horizontal axis giving an up-down movement of the aircraft nose measured by the [[angle of attack]].

*Yaw is a rotation about the vertical axis giving a side-to-side movement of the nose known as sideslip.

Flight dynamics is concerned with the stability and control of an aircraft's rotation about each of these axes.

====Stability====
[[File:Aircraft tail.JPG|thumb|The empennage of a [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747–200]]]]

An aircraft which is unstable tends to diverge from its current flight path and so is difficult to fly. An aircraft which is very stable tends to stay on its current flight path and is difficult to manoeuvre. So it is important for any design to achieve the desired degree of stability. Since the widespread use of digital computers, it is becoming increasingly common for designs to be inherently unstable and to rely on computerised control systems to provide artificial stability.

A fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch, roll and yaw. Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs need [[stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal and vertical stabilisers]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane&quot;&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 194. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. ISBN 1-56027-287-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GroundUp&quot;&gt;Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, ''From the Ground Up'', page 10 (27th revised edition) ISBN 0-9690054-9-0&lt;/ref&gt; which act in a similar way to the feathers on an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airlines.org/ATAResources/Handbook/Pages/AirlineHandbookChapter5HowAircraftFly.aspx ATA Airline Handbook Chapter 5: How Aircraft Fly&lt;/ref&gt; These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the [[flight dynamics]] of [[pitch (flight)|pitch]] and [[yaw angle|yaw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GroundUp&quot; /&gt; They are usually mounted on the tail section ([[empennage]]), although in the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] layout, the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer. [[Tandem wing|tandem]] and [[Tailless aircraft]] rely on the same general rule to achieve stability, the aft surface being the stabilising one.

A rotary wing is typically unstable in yaw, requiring a vertical stabiliser.

A balloon is typically very stable in pitch and roll due to the way the payload is hung underneath.

====Control====
[[Flight control surfaces]] enable the pilot to control an aircraft's [[Aircraft attitude|flight attitude]] and are usually part of the wing or mounted on, or integral with, the associated stabilizing surface. Their development was a critical advance in the history of aircraft, which had until that point been uncontrollable in flight.

[[Aerospace engineer]]s develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the [[aerodynamic center]] of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down. Control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag, for example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing.

The two main aerodynamic forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting it in the air and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may also be used to affect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.

==Impact and use==
In general, aircraft have positive properties as they permit long distance, high speed travel and are often [[Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation#Aircraft|reasonably efficient]]. In addition to their usefulness, they have some [[Environmental impact of aviation|environmental impacts]]. They generate some atmospheric pollution, are relatively [[aircraft noise|noisy]] compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate [[contrail]]s which experimental evidence suggests may [[global dimming|alter weather patterns]].

Aircraft are produced in several different types optimized for various uses; [[military aircraft]], which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft, and [[civil aviation|civil aircraft]], which include all non-military types, experimental and model.

{{Main|Military aircraft}}
A military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunston&quot; /&gt; Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:
* Combat aircraft are aircraft designed to destroy enemy equipment using its own armament.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunston&quot; /&gt; Combat aircraft divide broadly into [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] and [[bomber]]s, with several in-between types such as [[fighter-bomber]]s and [[ground-attack aircraft]] (including [[attack helicopter]]s).
* Non-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, but may carry weapons for self-defense. Non-combat roles include search and rescue, reconnaissance, observation, transport, training, and [[aerial refueling]]. These aircraft are often variants of civil aircraft.

Most military aircraft are powered heavier-than-air types. Other types such as [[Military glider|glider]]s and [[balloon]]s have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and [[military glider]]s were used during [[World War II]] to land troops.

===Civil===
[[Image:Pilatus Agusta A109 Flug.jpg|thumb|[[Agusta A109]] helicopter of the [[Rega (air rescue)|Swiss air rescue service]]]]
{{main|Civil aviation}}
Civil aircraft divide into ''commercial'' and ''general'' types, however there are some overlaps.

[[Commercial aviation|Commercial aircraft]] include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying passengers, [[Airmail|mail]] and other [[cargo]]. The larger passenger-carrying types are the airliners, the largest of which are [[wide-body aircraft]].  Some of the smaller types are also used in [[general aviation]], and some of the larger types are used as [[Air transports of heads of state and government|VIP aircraft]].

[[General aviation]] is a catch-all covering other kinds of [[Private aviation|private]] (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial use, and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as [[Business jet|business jets (bizjets)]], [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainers]], [[Homebuilt aircraft|homebuilt]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], [[warbird]]s and [[hot air balloon]]s to name a few. The vast majority of aircraft today are general aviation types.

===Experimental===
{{main|Experimental aircraft}}
An experimental aircraft is one that has not been fully proven in flight, or one that carries an FAA airworthiness certificate in the &quot;Experimental&quot; category. Often, this implies that new aerospace technologies are being tested on the aircraft, although the term also refers to amateur- and kit-built aircraft; many of which are based on proven designs.

'''Alfred Bernhard Nobel''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈɑlfred noˈbɛl}} {{audio|sv-Alfred_Nobel.ogg|listen}}; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist, engineer, innovator, and armaments manufacturer.  He was the inventor of [[dynamite]].  Nobel also owned [[Bofors]], which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 350 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. He used his fortune posthumously to institute the [[Nobel Prize]]s. The synthetic element [[nobelium]] was named after him. His name also survives in modern-day companies such as [[Dynamit Nobel]] and [[Akzo Nobel]], which are descendants of the companies Nobel himself established.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Stockholm]], Alfred Nobel was the fourth son of [[Immanuel Nobel]] (1801–1872), an inventor and engineer, and Karolina Andriette (Ahlsell) Nobel (1805–1889).{{r|Brit1}} The couple married in 1827 and had eight children. The family was impoverished, and only Alfred and his three brothers survived past childhood.{{r|Brit1}}&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Modern Europe: Europe 1789–1914: Encyclopedia of the Age of Industry and Empire'', &quot;Alfred Nobel&quot;, 2006 Thomson Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his father, Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist [[Olaus Rudbeck]] (1630–1702),&lt;ref&gt;Schück, Henrik, Ragnar Sohlman, Anders Österling, Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the Nobel Foundation, and Wilhelm Odelberg, eds. Nobel: The Man and His Prizes. 1950. 3rd ed. Coordinating Ed., Wilhelm Odelberg. New York: American Elsevier Publishing Company, Inc., 1972, p. 14. ISBN 0-444-00117-4, ISBN 978-0-444-00117-7. (Originally published in Swedish as Nobelprisen 50 år: forskare, diktare, fredskämpar.)&lt;/ref&gt; and in his turn the boy was interested in engineering, particularly explosives, learning the basic principles from his father at a young age. His interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svantelindqvist.com/anobel_inventor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|right]]
Following various business failures, Nobel's father moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1837 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented modern [[plywood]] and started work on the &quot;[[naval mine|torpedo]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=MWMIH&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man Who Made It Happen — Alfred Nobel|url=http://www.3833.com/wbn_nobel_alfred_bernhard|publisher=3833|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in English, French, German, and Russian.{{r|Brit1}} For 18 months, during 1841–1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child, the Jacobs Apologistic School in Stockholm.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Nobel's death mask.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred Nobel's [[death mask]], at Bjorkborn, Nobel's residence in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden.]]
As a young man, Nobel studied with chemist [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Zinin|Nikolai Zinin]]; then, in 1850, went to Paris to further the work; and, at 18, he went to the United States for four years to study chemistry, collaborating for a short period under inventor [[John Ericsson]], who designed the American Civil War ironclad ''[[USS Monitor]]''. Nobel filed his first patent, for a gas meter, in 1857.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, Rodney (2004). [http://books.google.com/books?id=pDbQVE3IdTcC&amp;pg=PA256 ''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries''], p. 256. John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc., New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-24410-4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Brit1}}

The family factory produced armaments for the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856); but, had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy.{{r|Brit1}} In 1859, Nobel's father left his factory in the care of the second son, [[Ludvig Nobel]] (1831–1888), who greatly improved the business. Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerine]] (discovered in 1847 by [[Ascanio Sobrero]], one of his fellow students under [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] at the [[University of Turin]]). Nobel invented a detonator in 1863; and, in 1865, he designed the [[blasting cap]].{{r|Brit1}}

On 3 September 1864, a shed, used for the preparation of nitroglycerin, exploded at the factory in [[Heleneborg]] Stockholm, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]].&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; Dogged by more minor accidents but unfazed, Nobel went on to build further factories, focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; Nobel invented [[dynamite]] in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable [[nitroglycerin]]. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally.{{r|Brit1}} In 1875 Nobel invented [[gelignite]], more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887 patented [[ballistite]], a forerunner of [[cordite]].{{r|Brit1}} 

Nobel was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1893.

Nobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert exploited oilfields along the [[Caspian Sea]] and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. During his life Nobel issued 350 [[patent]]s internationally and by his death had established 90 armaments factories, despite his belief in pacifism.{{r|Brit1}}
[[File:Alfred Nobel Medal 1975 by Richard Renninger.jpg|left|thumb|Alfred Nobel Medal 1975 by Richard Renninger]]

In 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error. A French obituary stated &quot;Le marchand de la mort est mort&quot; ''(&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;)''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416842/Alfred-Bernhard-Nobel Britannica, Alfred Nobel&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, following the death of his mother and his brother Ludvig and the end of a longstanding relationship, Nobel moved from Paris to [[Sanremo|San Remo]], Italy. Suffering from [[angina]], Nobel died at home, of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] in 1896. Unbeknownst to his family, friends or colleagues, he had left most of his wealth in trust, in order to fund the awards that would become known as the [[Nobel Prize]]s.{{r|Brit1}} He is buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

==Personal life==
Nobel travelled for much of his business life, maintaining companies in various countries in Europe and North America and keeping a permanent home in Paris from 1873 to 1891.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; He remained a solitary character, given to periods of depression. {{r|Brit1}} Though Nobel remained unmarried, his biographers note that he had at least three loves. Nobel's first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra, who rejected his proposal. In 1876 [[Austria|Austro]]-[[Bohemia]]n [[Freifrau|Countess]] [[Bertha von Suttner|Bertha Kinsky]] became Alfred Nobel's secretary. But after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, 'for her sincere peace activities'.
[[File:Björkborn exterior.jpg|thumb|upright|The Björkborn manor house, Nobel's residence at the time of his death, on the property of the [[Bofors]] iron works.]]

Nobel's third and longest-lasting relationship was with Sofie Hess from Vienna, whom he met in 1876.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; The liaison lasted for 18 years.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;  After his death, according to his biographers Evlanoff, Fluor, and Fant, Nobel's letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. They were released only in 1955, to be included with other biographical data.

In his religious views, Nobel was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Nobel, the loneliest millionaire|year=1969|publisher=W. Ritchie Press|author=Michael Evlanoff|coauthors=Marjorie Fluor|accessdate=12 April 2012|page=88|quote=He declared himself an agnostic in his youth, an atheist later, but at the same time, bestowed generous sums to the church...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: Swedish, French, Russian, English, German and Italian. He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English.' His ''[[Nemesis (play)|Nemesis]]'', a prose tragedy in four acts about [[Beatrice Cenci]], partly inspired by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[The Cenci]]'', was printed while he was dying. The entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish–[[Esperanto]]) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has been translated into [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] via the Esperanto version and into French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Nobel|title=Némésis: tragédie en quatre actes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VRUYPQAACAAJ|accessdate=19 August 2011|year=2008|publisher=Belles lettres|isbn=978-2-251-44342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 it was published in Russia in another bilingual ([[Russian language|Russian]]–Esperanto) edition.

==Inventions==
{{Main|Dynamite|Gelignite|Ballistite}}

Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' ([[diatomaceous earth]]) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as 'dynamite'. Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance &quot;Nobel's Safety Powder&quot;, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for 'power'.

Nobel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to [[collodion]], but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. 'Gelignite', or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the [[Age of Engineering]] bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An off-shoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of [[ballistite]], the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

==Nobel Prizes==
{{Main|Nobel Prize}}
{{Nobel Family}}
In 1888 Alfred's brother Ludvig died while visiting [[Cannes]] and a French newspaper erroneously published Alfred's [[List of premature obituaries|obituary]].{{r|Brit1}} It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death.{{r|Brit1}}{{r|HistC}} The obituary stated, ''{{lang|fr|Le marchand de la mort est mort}}'' (&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;){{r|Brit1}} and went on to say, &quot;Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.&quot;{{r|Nobel}} Alfred was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered.

On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 [[Swedish kronor]], to establish the five Nobel Prizes. This converted to GBP £1,687,837 at the time  &lt;ref&gt;At exchange rate of 18.5:1 in SEK:GBP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Håkan Lobell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Lobell, Håkan |title= Historical Monetary and Financial Statistics for Sweden Exchange rates,prices, and wages,1277–2008|publisher= S V E R I G E S R I K S B A N K|isbn=978-91-7092-124-7|year=2010|page=291|authorlink=#Håkan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrams7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Abrams, Irwin|title= The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates|publisher= Watson Publishing International|isbn=0-88135-388-4|year=2001|page=7|authorlink=#Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Fant 1991 327}} In 2012, the capital was worth around SEK 3.1 billion (USD 472 million, EUR 337 million), which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital, taking inflation into account.&lt;ref name=&quot;Håkan Lobell&quot;/&gt;

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence [[Nobel Prize in Physics|in physical science]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|in chemistry]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|in medical science or physiology]]; the fourth is [[Nobel Prize for Literature|for literary work]] &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and [[Nobel Peace Prize|the fifth prize]] is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international [[wikt:fraternity|fraternity]], in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses.

The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (''{{lang|sv|i idealisk riktning}}'' in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less Romantic authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]], who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.

In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-grandnephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] is actually a &quot;Nobel Prize&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/nobel/article235455.ece &quot;Alfred Nobels familie tar avstand fra økonomiprisen&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*****  EDITORS NOTE:  *****

The question of nationality is a contentious one in that Alexander Graham Bell has been variously claimed as Scottish, British, American and Canadian. Bell made a number of inventions as a formal British citizen after immigrating to Canada and then moving to the United States, notably the telephone in 1876; however he did not become an American citizen until 1882. Therefore if nationality is to be described specifically ... Alexander Graham Bell—British inventor of the telephone, died as an American citizen in Canada. The wording in the lead paragraph was carefully crafted after input from many editors to accommodate the many diverse claims. It is recognized that in the last years of his life, Bell had American citizenship although he predominately lived in Canada at his estate.  His life's work and details on his nationality and citizenship are provided in later sections. Please discuss any potentially divisive submissions prior to editing the introductory lede section.

Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on [[elocution]] and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first [[United States patent law|US patent]] for the telephone in 1876.{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;He thought he could harness the new [[Electronics|electronic technology]] by creating a machine with a transmitter and receiver that would send sounds telegraphically to help people hear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Black 1997, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; |group=N}}  In retrospect, Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|

After Bell's death his wife Mabel wrote to [[John J.

Of course, he never had one in his study. That was where he went when he wanted to be alone with his thoughts and his work. The telephone, of course, means intrusion by the outside world. And the little difficulties and delays often attending the establishment of conversation... did irritate him, so that as a rule he preferred having others send and receive messages. But all really important business over the telephone he transacted himself. There are few private houses more completely equipped with telephones than ours...  and there was nothing that Mr. Bell was more particular about than our telephone service... We never could have come here [to Beinn Bhreagh] in the first place or continued here, but for the telephone which kept us in close touch with doctors and neighbors and the regular telegraph office. . . .  Mr. Bell did like to say in fun, &quot;Why did I ever invent the Telephone,&quot; but no one had a higher appreciation of its indispensableness or used it more freely when need was—either personally or by deputy —and he was really tremendously proud of it and all it was accomplishing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Mabel.

==Early life==
Alexander Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland on March 3, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription, marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845–70) and Edward Charles Bell (1848–67). Both of his brothers died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/bellhtml/belltime.html &quot;Time Line of Alexander Graham Bell.&quot;] ''memory.loc.goiv.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Professor [[Alexander Melville Bell]], and his mother was Eliza Grace (née Symonds).{{#tag:ref|&quot;Alexander M. Bell Dead. Father of Prof. A.G.

===First invention===
As a child, young Alexander displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age. His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays. Young Aleck asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce p. 16.&quot;&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to &quot;invent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce p. 16.&quot;/&gt;

From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and &quot;voice tricks&quot; akin to [[ventriloquism]] that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;/&gt; Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 9&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay p.25&quot;&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study [[acoustics]].

His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his ''The Standard Elocutionist'' (1860),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;/&gt; which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. ''The Standard Elocutionist'' appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct [[deaf-mute]]s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Aleck's father taught him and his brothers not only to write [[Visible Speech]] but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie p. 7&quot;&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Aleck became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including [[Latin]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and even [[Sanskrit]], accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie p. 7&quot;/&gt;

===Education===
As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, Bell secured a position as a &quot;pupil-teacher&quot; of [[elocution]] and music, in Weston House Academy, at [[Elgin, Moray]], Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]]; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Aleck completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First experiments with sound===
Bell's father encouraged Aleck's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique [[automaton]], developed by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] based on the earlier work of [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rudimentary &quot;mechanical man&quot; simulated a human voice. Aleck was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a &quot;big prize&quot; if they were successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;/&gt; While his brother constructed the throat and [[larynx]], Aleck tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could &quot;speak&quot;, albeit only a few words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;/&gt; The boys would carefully adjust the &quot;lips&quot; and when a [[bellows]] forced air through the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], a very recognizable &quot;Mama&quot; ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie pp. 7–9&quot;&gt;Petrie 1975, pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's [[Skye Terrier]], &quot;Trouve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After he taught it to growl continuously, Aleck would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] to produce a crude-sounding &quot;Ow ah oo ga ma ma&quot;. With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate &quot;How are you grandma?&quot; More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a &quot;talking dog&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 30.&quot; &quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using [[tuning fork]]s to explore [[resonance]].

At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 30.&quot; &quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Aleck a copy of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s work, ''The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork &quot;contraption&quot;, he pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own errant mistranslation of a French edition,&lt;ref name=&quot;DictionaryOfCanBiography&quot; /&gt; Aleck fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: &quot;Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech.&quot;  He also later remarked: &quot;I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKenzie2008&quot;&gt;MacKenzie 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Helmholtz's ''The Sensations of Tone'' is credited with inspiring Bell, at age 23, to further his studies of electricity and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=&quot;DictionaryOfCanBiography&quot; /&gt;|group=N}}

===Family tragedy===
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,&lt;ref&gt;Micklos 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a [[telegraph]] wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward &quot;Ted,&quot; was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as &quot;A.G. Bell&quot;) and served the next year as an instructor at [[Somerset College]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at the [[University College London]], Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in [[South Kensington]], London. His first two pupils were &quot;deaf mute&quot; girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The family pet was given to his brother's family.|group=N}} conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and join his father and mother in setting out for the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt;

In 1870, at age 23, Bell, his brother's widow, Caroline (Margaret Ottaway),&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and his parents travelled on the SS ''Nestorian'' to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; After landing at [[Quebec City]] the Bells transferred to another steamer to [[Montreal]] and then boarded a train to [[Paris, Ontario]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-2006.b&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a farm of {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near [[Brantford]], Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house and a [[carriage house]], which bordered the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| The estate, dating from 1858, is in the present day located at 94 Tutela Heights Road, Brantford, and is now known as the &quot;Bell Homestead&quot;, and formally as the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead National Historic Site of Canada]].

After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wing p. 10&quot;&gt;Wing 1980, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also modified a [[Pump organ|melodeon]] (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldi-undated&quot;&gt;Waldie, Jean H. &quot;Historic Melodeon Is Given To Bell Museum&quot;, likely published either by the ''[[London Free Press]]'' or by the ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', date unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.

Bell's father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public [[Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing|Horace Mann School for the Deaf]]),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; in Boston, Massachusetts, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post, in favor of his son. Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the [[American School for the Deaf|American Asylum for Deaf-mutes]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut, and the [[Clarke School for the Deaf]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], Massachusetts.

Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his &quot;harmonic telegraph&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Graham Bell' 1979, p. 8&quot;&gt;''Alexander Graham Bell'' 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In later years, Bell described the invention of the telephone and linked it to his &quot;dreaming place&quot;.|group=N}}  The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Groundwater p. 39&quot;/&gt; Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Petrina 1975, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872 Alexander Bell opened his &quot;School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech&quot; in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils with his first class numbering 30 students.&lt;ref&gt;Petrel 1975, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was [[Helen Keller]], who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that &quot;inhuman silence which separates and estranges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that ought to be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of [[sign language]], thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-Branson&quot;&gt;Miller and Branson 2002, pp. 30–31, 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; However in several schools children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in order to force them to attempt oral communication. Due to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing [[deaf culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers et al. 2009, pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing experimentation==
In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the [[Boston University]] School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was &quot;swept up&quot; by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping up &quot;night owl&quot; hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 39&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.

Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell only retained two students, six-year old &quot;Georgie&quot; Sanders, deaf from birth and 15-year old [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]]. Each pupil would serve to play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay at nearby [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to &quot;experiment&quot;. Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together with free room and board thrown in.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years his junior but became the object of Bell's affection.

Mabel's exact age when she became deaf would later play a part in the debate on the effectiveness of [[Manualism and oralism|manual versus oral education for deaf children]], as children who are older at the onset of deafness retain greater vocalization skills and are thus more successful in oral education programs. Some of the debate centred on whether Mabel had to relearn oral speech from scratch, or whether she never lost it.|group=N}} she had learned to [[Lip reading|read lips]] but her father, [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn 1990, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telephone==
&lt;!--The question of authorship or claims to the invention of the telephone is discussed in the sub-article Invention of the Telephone. Although there remain disputes between various parties that were eventually resolved in litigation, this still remains a contentious issue. Before introducing any further controversial issues related to the invention of the telephone, please discuss on the talk page.--&gt;
{{Main|Invention of the telephone}}

By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage with progress it made both at his new Boston &quot;laboratory&quot; (a rented facility) as well as at his family home in Canada a big success.{{#tag:ref| Quote: &quot;Brantford is justified in calling herself 'The Telephone City' because the telephone originated there. It was invented in Brantford at Tutela Heights in the summer of 1874.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Graham Bell' 1979, p. 8&quot;/&gt;|group=N}}
While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a &quot;[[phonautograph]]&quot;, a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 1999, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 1999, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of [[Western Union]] President William Orton, had become &quot;the nervous system of commerce&quot;. Orton had contracted with inventors [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Elisha Gray]] to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net/reiman/03_2005.htm &quot;A History of Electrical Engineering.&quot;] ''ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net''. Retrieved: December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's [[patent attorney]], [[Anthony Pollok]].&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, pp. 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist [[Joseph Henry]], who was then director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had &quot;the germ of a great invention&quot;. When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, &quot;Get it!&quot; That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and [[Thomas A. Watson]], an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.

With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant,{{#tag:ref| Hubbard's financial support to the research efforts fell far short of the funds needed, necessitating Bell to continue teaching while conducting his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Brian. [http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2001/09-14/bell.html &quot;Alexander Graham Bell: The BU Years.&quot;] ''B.U. Bridge,''  Vol. V, No. 5, 14 September 2001. Retrieved: 28 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was so short of funds at times that he had to borrow money from his own employee, [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]]. Bell also sought an additional CAD$150 from the former [[Premier (Canada)|Premier of Canada]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], in exchange for 50% of the patent rights in the British Empire (Brown later retracted his offer to patent the telephone in the U.K. for fear of being ridiculed). The [[Bell_Telephone_Company#Predecessor_to_the_Bell_Company|Bell Patent Association]], composed of Hubbard, Sanders and Bell and which would become the precursor of the Bell Telephone Company (and later, [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]), would later assign an approximate 10% interest of its shares to Watson,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; in lieu of salary and for his earlier financial support to Bell while they worked together creating their first functional telephone.|group=N}} and the two of them experimented with [[acoustic telegraphy]]. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the &quot;[[gallows]]&quot; [[sound-powered telephone]], which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.

===The race to the patent office===
{{Main|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}

In 1875, Bell developed an [[Acoustic Telegraph|acoustic telegraph]] and drew up a [[patent application]] for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--not in the right article- belongs in the Gray and Bell controversy---NPOV involved--[[File:Bell-gray-smoking-gun.png|thumb|Excerpts from Elisha Gray's patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander Graham Bell's lab notebook entry of March 8, note their similarity]]---&gt;
[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: &quot;Improvement in Telegraphy&quot; filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing, March 7, 1876.]]

Meanwhile, [[Elisha Gray]] was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent.  Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.

Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. Bell's patent covered &quot;the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown, described as &quot;probably the most valuable patent ever.&quot;|group=N}} Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.

On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the [[electrical resistance]] in the circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence &quot;Mr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you&quot; into the liquid transmitter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr002.html &quot;Bell's Lab notebook I, pp. 40–41 (image 22).&quot;] ''loc.gov.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray,&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible &quot;articulate speech&quot; (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the Examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because Gray did not contest Bell's priority, the Examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Patent clerk|patent examiner]], Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in a sworn affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, [[Marcellus Bailey]], with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in a sworn affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mr. Wilbur confesses.&quot; ''The Washington Post,'' May 22, 1886, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in [[County of Brant|Mount Pleasant]] five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexander Graham Telephone in Newyork.jpg|thumb|Bell at the opening of the long-distance line from New York to Chicago in 1892.]]
Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25&amp;nbsp;million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.&lt;ref&gt;Fenster, Julie M.

Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the [[scientific community]] as well as the general public. A short time later, [[Bell Telephone Company#Early promotional success|his demonstration of an early telephone prototype]] at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] brought the telephone to international attention.&lt;ref&gt;Webb 1991, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential visitors to the exhibition included [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II of Brazil]]. Later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (later, Lord Kelvin), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to [[Queen Victoria]] who had requested a private audience at [[Osborne House]], her [[Isle of Wight]] home. She called the demonstration &quot;most extraordinary&quot;. The enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1995, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the [[carbon microphone]] from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.

In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental [[telephone call]]. Calling from the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]] at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. The ''New York Times'' reported:

She was 82 years old.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
Marian was born only days after Bell and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] had successfully tested their new wireless telecommunication invention at their [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]], one which Bell would name as his greatest achievement. Bell was so ecstatic that he wanted to jointly name his new invention and his new daughter [[Photophone]] (Greek: &quot;''light–sound''&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor &amp; Wesson&quot;&gt;Grosvenor and Wesson 1997, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carson-2007-gvttw&quot;&gt;Carson 2007, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell wrote:  &quot;Only think!—Two babies in one week!

The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when Bell's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for Bell's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, pp. 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was a [[British subject]] throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In 1915, he characterized his status as: &quot;I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a &quot;native son&quot; by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom&lt;!-- Bell also lived in London, so 'UK' is more appropriate than 'Scotland' --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on [[Cape Breton Island]] in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot;&gt;Bethune 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethune 2009, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1889, a large house, christened ''The Lodge'' was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot; /&gt; were begun that the Bells would name [[Beinn Bhreagh]] (Gaelic: ''beautiful mountain'') after Alec's ancestral [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch 2006, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{#tag:ref|Under the direction of the Boston architects, Cabot, Everett and Mead, a Nova Scotia company, Rhodes, Curry and Company, carried out the actual construction.|group=N}}Bell would spend his final, and some of his most productive, years in residence in both Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but ''Beinn Bhreagh'' would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened.

==Later inventions==
[[File:AG Bell 1.jpg|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell in his later years.]]
{{Commons|Alexander_Graham_Bell#Inventions|Bell's many inventions}}

Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, [[Charlotte Gray (author)|Charlotte Gray]], Bell's work ranged ''&quot;unfettered across the scientific landscape&quot;'' and he often went to bed voraciously reading the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', scouring it for new areas of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the [[photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for &quot;hydroairplanes&quot; and two for [[selenium]] cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the [[audiometer]] to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding [[alternative fuel]]s.

Bell worked extensively in [[medical research]] and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a [[magnetic field]] on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the [[tape recorder]], the [[hard disc]] and [[floppy disc]] drive and other [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]].

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. [[Methane]] gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with [[composting toilet]]s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s to heat houses.

===Photophone===
{{main|Photophone}}
[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|Photophone receiver, one half of Bell's wireless optical communication system]]

Bell and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a [[photophone]], which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of [[light]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDU&quot;&gt;Jones, Newell.

Retrieved from the ''University of San Diego History Department'' website, November 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men later became full associates in the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Laboratory projects|Volta Laboratory Association]].

On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] in Washington, D.C., to Bell at the window of his laboratory, some {{convert|213|m|ft|-2}} away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carson-2007-gvttw&quot;&gt;Carson 2007, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Groth&quot;&gt;Groth, Mike.

Bell believed the photophone's principles were his life's &quot;greatest achievement&quot;, telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was &quot;the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Donald J.C., and Laura Neilson.

===Metal detector===
[[File:Telephone Inventor’s Voice Heard in Restored Recording « Science World.theora.ogv|thumbnail|Bell's voice, from a [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] recording in 1885. Restored by the Smithsonian in 2013.]]

Bell is also credited with the invention of the [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President [[James Garfield]]. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;&gt;Grosvenor and Wesson 1997, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;/&gt; Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;/&gt;

Bell's own detailed account, presented to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet. Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell &quot;...proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning...to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect.&quot; In a footnote, Bell adds that &quot;The death of President Garfield and the subsequent ''post-mortem'' examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A. 1882. &quot;Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body.&quot; [http://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell (Available at archive.org)].

===Hydrofoils===
{{Main|HD-4}}
[[File:Bell HD-4.jpg|thumb|Bell [[HD-4]] on a test run ca. 1919]]

The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]]s. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910–11, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the ''Dhonnas Beag'', the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial [[HD-4]], powered by [[Renault]] engines. A top speed of {{convert|54|mph|km/h}} was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia]] to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two 350 [[horsepower]] (260&amp;nbsp;kW) engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour (114.04&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; a record which stood for ten years.

===Aeronautics===
{{Main|Aerial Experiment Association|AEA Silver Dart}}
[[File:AEA Silver Dart.jpg|thumb|AEA Silver Dart ca.&amp;nbsp;1909]]

In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek &quot;young&quot; help as Alexander was at the graceful age of 60.

In 1898, Bell experimented with [[tetrahedral]] [[box kite]]s and wings constructed of multiple compound [[tetrahedral kite]]s covered in maroon silk.{{#tag:ref|Bell was inspired in part by Australian aeronautical engineer [[Lawrence Hargrave]]'s work with man-carrying box kites.&lt;ref&gt;''Technical Gazette'', New South Wales, 1924, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrave declined to take patents on his inventions, similar to Bell's decision not to file patents on some of his inventions. Bell also chose maroon-colored silk as it would show up clearly against the light-colored sky in his photographic studies.|group=&quot;N&quot;}} The tetrahedral wings were named ''Cygnet'' I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (''Cygnet I'' crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the [[Alexander Graham Bell honors and tributes|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html &quot;Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook.&quot;] ''ns1763.ca''. Retrieved: December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was a supporter of [[aerospace engineering]] research through the [[Aerial Experiment Association]] (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel]] and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillis&quot;&gt;Gillis, Rannie.

Curtiss]], a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title &quot;world's fastest man&quot;, having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the [[Scientific American|Scientific American Trophy]] for the first official one-kilometre flight in the [[Western hemisphere]], and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]], an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and the only person in the army who believed aviation was the future; [[Frederick W. Baldwin]], the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in [[Hammondsport, New York|Hammondsport]], New York, and [[J.A.D.

The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the ''[[AEA Red Wing|Red Wing]]'', framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small [[Engine cooling|air-cooled]] engine.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 1908, over [[Keuka Lake]], the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.{{#tag:ref|&quot;Selfridge Aerodrome Sails Steadily for {{convert|319|ft|m}}.&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'' May 13, 1908.|group=N}} {{#tag:ref| At 25 to 30 Miles an Hour.

However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard#Support to aeronautical research|$15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell]] allowed it to continue with experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their final aircraft design, the ''[[AEA Silver Dart|Silver Dart]]'' embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell was present as the ''Silver Dart'' flown by J.A.D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=|first1=|date=October 19, 1956|title=Link with Canadian Pioneers |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |volume=70|issue=2491|page=642|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%201488.html|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the ''Silver Dart'' would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the [[Canadian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eugenics==
&lt;!--Bell's work with Eugenics is still considered contentious. Any submissions to this section should be documented in the &quot;talk page&quot; associated with this article.--&gt;
Bell was connected with the [[eugenics]] movement in the United States. In his lecture ''Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race'' presented to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Alexander Graham. [http://saveourdeafschools.org/race.pdf &quot;Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race.&quot;] ''Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf'', 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist [[David Starr Jordan]]'s Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the [[American Breeders Association]]. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 410–417.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the [[Eugenics Record Office]] associated with [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a &quot;defective variety of the human race&quot;. By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Lusane 2003, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anatolia and Europe NASA modified.PNG|thumb|300px|The location of [[Turkey]] (within the rectangle) in reference to the [[Europe|European continent]]. Anatolia roughly corresponds to the [[Asia]]n part of Turkey.]]

'''Anatolia''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀνατολή}}, ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Anatolḗ}}'' — &quot;east&quot; or &quot;(sun)rise&quot;), also known as '''Asia Minor''' (from {{Lang-el|Μικρὰ Ἀσία}} ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Mīkrá Asía}}'' (&quot;small Asia&quot;); in modern {{Lang-tr|Anadolu|links=no}}), '''Asian Turkey''', '''Anatolian peninsula''', '''Anatolian plateau''', and '''[[Turkey]]''', denotes the westernmost protrusion of [[Asia]], which makes up the majority of the [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Anatolia.aspx &quot;Anatolia comprises more than 95 percent of Turkey's total land area.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The region is bounded by the [[Black Sea]] to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, and the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west. The [[Sea of Marmara]] forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] straits and separates Anatolia from [[Thrace]] on the [[Europe]]an mainland. Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the [[Gulf of İskenderun]] and the Black Sea, approximately corresponding to the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey. However, since Anatolia is now often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the [[Turkey|Turkish]] borders with the neighboring countries, which are [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]], in clockwise direction.

Anatolia has been inhabited by many peoples throughout history, such as the [[Hattians]], [[Hurrians]], [[Hittites]], [[Luwians]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Mitanni]], [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]],  [[Urartians]], [[Caria]]ns, [[Commagene]], [[Cilicia]]ns, [[Arameans]], [[Kaskians]], [[Mushki]], [[Palaic]], [[Corduene]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Colchians]], [[Caucasian Iberians|Iberians]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Kurds]], [[Laz people|Laz]], [[Zazas]], [[Hamshenis]], [[Sephardi Jews]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Karachays]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Circassians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Seljuk Turks]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], and today predominantly modern [[Turkish people]]. Each culture left behind unique artifacts, still being uncovered by archaeologists.

==Definition==
[[File:AnatolieLimits.jpg|thumb|300px|The traditional definition of Anatolia within modern Turkey]]
The Anatolian peninsula, also called Asia Minor, is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe.

Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the [[Gulf of İskenderun]] to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used, for example, in the latest edition of ''[[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=2001 |isbn=0 87779 546 0 |page=46 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA883&amp;dq=anatolia+geographical+dictionary&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=18 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the archeological community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; Under this definition, Anatolia is bounded to the East by the [[Armenian Highland]], and the [[Euphrates]] before that river bends to the southeast to enter [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;&gt;Stephen Mitchell, ''Anatolia: Land, Men, and Gods in Asia Minor. The Celts in Anatolia and the impact of Roman rule''. Clarendon Press, Aug 24, 1995 - 296 pages. ISBN 978-0198150299 [http://books.google.com/books?id=pUYtwuve40kC&amp;dq=anatolia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1OC3T-CDDoGsiAL4q7X-Bg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; To the southeast, it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in [[Syria (region)]] and the Mesopotamian plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt;

However, following the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|establishment of the Republic of Turkey]], Anatolia was defined by the Turkish government as being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's [[First Geography Congress, Turkey|First Geography Congress]] in 1941 created two [[geographical regions of Turkey|regions]] to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] and the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Yigit&quot;&gt;Ali Yiğit, &quot;Geçmişten Günümüze Türkiye'yi Bölgelere Ayıran Çalışmalar ve Yapılması Gerekenler&quot;, ''Ankara Üniversitesi Türkiye Coğrafyası Araştırma ve Uygulama Merkezi, IV.

This wider definition of Anatolia has gained widespread currency outside of Turkey and has, for instance, been adopted by ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22897/Anatolia |title=Anatolia |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other encyclopedic and general reference publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Anatolia.aspx |title=''Anatolia'' entries from ''Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa'', ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', and ''A Dictionary of World History''|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Anatolia}}
Anatolia has been home to many civilizations throughout history, such as the [[Hattians]], [[Hurrians]], [[Luwians]],  [[Hittites]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Urartians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Caria]]ns, [[Scythians]], [[Corduene]],  [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Georgians]], [[Circassians]], [[Kurds]], [[Seljuk Turks]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. As a result, Anatolia is one of the archaeologically richest places on earth. Two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] were located in Anatolia: The [[Temple of Artemis|Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]] and the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]].

===Etymology===
The oldest known reference to Anatolia, &quot;Land of the [[Hittite empire|Hatti]]&quot;, was found for the first time on [[Mesopotamian]] cuneiform tablets from the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2350–2150 BC).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} On those tablets the northern Akkadian [[Assyria]]n traders implored the help of the Akkadian king [[Sargon the Great]]. This appellation continued to exist for about 1500 years until approximately 620 BC, as stated in the chronicles of the [[Assyrian Empire]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Later, the Anatolian peninsula was given the name ''[[:wikt:Asia|Asia]]'' (Ἀσία) by the Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa Ἀσία], ''A Greek-English Lexicon''], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; presumably after the name of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} As the name Asia came to be extended to other areas east of the Mediterranean, the name for Anatolian became specified as Asia Minor (&quot;Lesser Asia&quot;, Μικρὰ Ἀσία) in [[Late Antiquity]].

The name ''Anatolia'' comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|Aνατολή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Anatolē}}'') meaning the &quot;East&quot; or more literally &quot;sunrise&quot;, comparable to the Latin terms &quot;[[Levant]]&quot; or &quot;[[Orient]]&quot; (and words for &quot;east&quot; in other languages).&lt;ref name=&quot;etym&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237638| author=Henry George Liddell | coauthors=Robert Scott| title=A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anatolia Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring to the [[Ionians|Ionian]] colonies on the west coast of Asia Minor. (The male name [[Anatoly]] or [[Anatole (disambiguation)|Anatole]] shares the same linguistic origin.)

In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Anatolic Theme]] (Aνατολικόν θέμα) was a ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'' covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day [[Central Anatolia Region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Thema 1952, pp. 59&quot;&gt;&quot;On the First Thema, called Anatolikon. This theme is called Anatolikon or Theme of the Anatolics  &quot;Aνατολικόν θέμα&quot;, not because it is above and in the direction of the east where the sun rises, but because it lies to the East of Byzantium and Europe.&quot; Constantine VII Porphyogenitus, ''De Thematibus'', ed. A. Pertusi. Vatican: [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]], 1952, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;John Haldon 2002. Page 32&quot;&gt;John Haldon, ''Byzantium, a History'', 2002. Page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the medieval [[Khazars|Khazar Empire]], a Turkic state on the northern shores of the Black and Caspian seas, was referred to as ''Tourkia'' (''Land of the Turks'') in Byzantine sources.

===Antiquity===
[[File:Anatolia Ancient Regions base.svg|right|thumb|300px|Ancient regions of Anatolia]]
[[File:Map Hittite rule en.svg|right|thumb|Approximate extent of [[Hittites|Hittite]] rule, c. 1350-1300 BC, with [[Arzawa]] rule and [[Lukkans]] to the west, [[Mitanni]] rule to the South-East.]]

[[Neolithic]] Anatolia has been [[Anatolian hypothesis|proposed]] as the [[Urheimat|homeland]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], although linguists tend to favour a [[Kurgan hypothesis|later origin]] in the steppes north of the Black Sea. However, it is clear that the Indo-European [[Anatolian languages]] had been present in Anatolia since at least the 19th century BC.

Eastern Anatolia contains the oldest monumental structures in the world. For example, the monumental structures at [[Göbekli Tepe]] were built by hunters and gatherers a thousand years before the development of agriculture. Eastern Anatolia, alongside [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]], is a heart region for the [[Neolithic Revolution]], one of the earliest areas in which humans domesticated plants and animals. Neolithic sites such as [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Çayönü]], [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Hacilar]] represent the world's oldest known agricultural towns.

The earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the [[Mesopotamia]]-based [[Akkadian Empire]] during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] in the 24th century BC. Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]]. The Hattians spoke a [[Hattic language|language]] of unclear affiliation, and the [[Hurrian language]] belongs to a small family called [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]], all these languages now being extinct; relationships with indigenous [[languages of the Caucasus]] have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 2005:12&lt;/ref&gt; but are not generally accepted. The region was famous for exporting raw materials, and areas of [[Hittite empire|Hattian]]- and Hurrian-populated southeast Anatolia were colonised by the Akkadians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;/&gt;

After the fall of the Akkadian empire in the mid-21st century BC, the [[Assyrians]], who were the northern branch of the Akkadian people, colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries BC and claimed the resources, notably [[silver]]. One of the numerous [[cuneiform]] records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of [[Kanesh]], uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Charles|title= Egypt, Greece and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999|isbn=0-19-872194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Semitic]] Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] in north-central Anatolia by 2000 BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language known as the &quot;[[Nesili|language of Nesa]]&quot;. Originating from [[Kültepe|Nesa]], they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations.

The Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform]] written script, invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 2000 BC, they created an empire, the [[Hittite New Kingdom]], which reached its height in the 14th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor. The empire included a large part of Anatolia, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as another non-Indo-European people, the [[Kaskians]], had established a kingdom there in the 17th century BC, displacing earlier [[Palaic]] speaking Indo-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Carruba, O. ''Das Palaische. Texte, Grammatik, Lexikon''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1970. StBoT 10&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the history of the Hittite Empire was concerned with warring with the rival empires of [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Mitanni]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roux&quot;&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalyan - Caunos2.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Lycian rock cut tombs of Kaunos (Dalyan)]]
The [[Mitanni]] Empire was also an Indo-European (and Hurrian)-speaking and Anatolian-based empire. The Mitanni appeared in the 17th century BC and spoke an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language related to the Indo-European languages eventually to be found in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 229. Penguin Books, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptians]] eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the Hittites and becoming wary of the power of Assyria, which had destroyed the Mitanni Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roux&quot;/&gt; The Assyrians and Hittites were then left in the field to battle over control over eastern and southern Anatolia and colonial territories in [[Syria]]. The Assyrians had better success than the Egyptians, annexing much Hittite (and Hurrian) territories in these regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux 1966&quot;&gt;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq. Penguin Books, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Templeofathenaprienemay2007.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The temple of [[Athena]] in the Greek city of [[Priene]]]]
After 1180 BC, the Hittite empire [[Bronze Age collapse|disintegrated]] into several independent &quot;[[Neo-Hittite]]&quot; states, subsequent to losing much territory to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] and being finally overrun by the [[Phrygians]], another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the [[Balkans]]. The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux 1966&quot;/&gt;

Ancient Anatolia is subdivided by modern scholars into regions named after the Indo-European (and largely Hittite, Luwian or Greek speaking) peoples that occupied them, such as [[Lydia]], [[Lycia]], [[Caria]], [[Mysia]], [[Bithynia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Galatia]], [[Lycaonia]], [[Pisidia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Cilicia]], and [[Cappadocia]].

Semitic [[Arameans]] encroached over the borders of south central Anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the Hittite empire, and some of the [[Neo-Hittite]] states in this region became an amalgam of Hittites and Arameans. These became known as [[Syro-Hittite states]].

[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' c. 230 BC, a Roman copy of a Greek statue commemorating the victory over the Celtic [[Galatia]]ns in Anatolia]]
In central and western Anatolia, another Indo-European people, the [[Luwians]], came to the fore, circa 2000 BC. Their language was closely related to [[Hittite language|Hittite]].&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken—to a greater or lesser degree—across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the [[Gediz River|Hermos]] and/or [[Bakırçay|Kaikos]] valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 1994; id. 1995:144–51; Starke 1997; Melchert 2003; for the geography Hawkins 1998&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]], all of which had [[Greece|Hellenic]] influence.

The north western coasts of Anatolia were inhabited by Greeks of the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]]/[[Mycenae]]an culture from the 20th century BC, related to the Greeks of south eastern Europe and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the [[Bronze Age collapse]] at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by [[Ionian Greeks]], usurping the related but earlier [[Mycenaean Greeks]]. Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek [[city-state]]s were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia ([[Pre-Socratic philosophy]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Hurrian kingdoms, such as [[Nairi]] and the powerful state of [[Urartu]] arose in northeastern Anatolia from the 10th century BC, before eventually falling to the [[Assyrians]]. During the same period the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] states of [[Colchis]] and [[Tabal]] arose around the Black Sea and central Anatolia respectively.

From the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]]. The Cimmerians overran [[Phrygia]] and the Scythians threatened to do the same to Urartu and [[Lydia]], before both were finally checked by the [[Assyrians]].

[[File:Pergamon - 04.jpg|thumb|Temple of Trajan at [[Pergamon]].]]
From the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the east, central, southwestern and southeastern regions) fell to the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], including all of the [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Syro-Hittite]] states, Phrygia, Urartu, [[Nairi]], [[Tabal]], [[Cilicia]], [[Commagene]], [[Caria]], Lydia, the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and swathes of [[Cappadocia]].

The Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], Scythians and their own [[Babylonian]] relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.

Anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted [[coin]]age (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in [[Mesopotamia]] at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the [[Hellenistic period|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0-415-08992-1|last=Howgego|first=C. J.|title=Ancient History from Coins|authorlink=Christopher Howgego| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaminorcoins.com/ Asia Minor Coins] - an index of Greek and Roman coins from Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 6th century BC, most of Anatolia was conquered by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], the Persians having usurped the [[Medes]] as the dominant dynasty in [[Iran]]. Also in the 6th century BC, the Indo-European [[Armenian people|Armenians]] founded the [[Orontid Dynasty]] in [[Urartu]]. In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The [[Ionian Revolt]], as it became known, initiated the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence.

In 334 BC, the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Greek king [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roisman|first1=Joseph|last2=Worthington|first2=Ian|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2010|isbn=1-4051-7936-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lkYFVJ3U-BIC|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence. Following the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalids of Pergamum]] and the [[Seleucids]], the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful [[Hellenization]] followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]], and western and central Anatolia came under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] control, but [[Hellenistic culture]] remained predominant. During the 1st century BC the Armenians established the powerful [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian kingdom]] under [[Tigran]] who reigned throughout much of eastern Anatolia between the Caspian, Black, and Mediterranean seas. Areas of the southeast such as [[Harran]] and the [[Hakkari]] mountains continued to be inhabited by remnants of the [[Assyrians]], but these regions remained under [[Parthian language|Parthian]] and then [[Sassanid]] [[Persian language|Persian]] rule.

===Medieval and Renaissance periods===
[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine Anatolia and the Byzantine-Arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century]]
[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|right|300px|Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300.]]

After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]].  Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world.  Byzantine control was challenged by [[Arab]] raids starting in the 8th century (see [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]]), but in the 9th and 10th century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories and even expanded beyond its traditional borders, into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]] (ancient [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]). In the 10 years following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the [[Seljuk Turks]] from [[Central Asia]] established themselves over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the north western rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204 |last=Angold |first=Michael |coauthors= |year=1997 |isbn=0-582-29468-1 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although some ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rûm]], with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced. In 1255, the [[Mongols]] swept through eastern and central Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The [[Ilkhanate]] garrison was stationed near [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Balyuzi ''Muḥammad and the course of Islám'', p.342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Freely ''Storm on Horseback: The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey'', p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various [[Anatolian beyliks]].  Smyrna fell in 1330, and the last Byzantine stronghold in Anatolia, Philadelphia, fell in 1390. The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk Sultans.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, Gary Leiser-The origins of the Ottoman empire, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Partner ''God of battles: holy wars of Christianity and Islam'', p.122&lt;/ref&gt; The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the [[Mongol]] [[Ilkhanids]].&lt;ref&gt;''Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Osmanli]] ruler [[Osman I]] was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s, for it bears the legend &quot;Minted by Osman son of Ertugul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Artuk - O''smanli Beyliginin Kurucusu'', 27f&lt;/ref&gt; Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to a [[sovereign]], it can be considered that Osmanli became independent of the Mongol Khans.&lt;ref&gt;Pamuk - ''A Monetary History'', p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the [[Mongol Empire]]'s legacy in the region was the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[Eretna Dynasty]] that was overthrown by [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth-The new Islamic dynasties: a chronological and genealogical manual, p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] leaders the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman and his son [[Orhan I]]. The Anatolian beyliks were in turn absorbed into the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th century. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of [[Halicarnassus]] (modern [[Bodrum]]) from the [[Knights of Saint John]].

===Modern times===
[[File:Ethnicturkey1911.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ethnographic map of Anatolia from 1911.]]

With the beginning of the slow decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of [[Czarist Russia]] in the [[Caucasus]], many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly [[Circassians]], [[Tatars]], [[Azeris]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgis]], [[Chechens]] and several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups left their ancestral homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims ([[Bosnians]], [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Greek Macedonia]], Bulgaria, Northern Macedonia), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy, ''Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821-1922'', 1996, ISBN 0-87850-094-4&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, Constantinopole and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe. Following the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern [[Armenia]] into the Russian Empire, another reverse migration involved the large [[Armenians|Armenian]] population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from [[Western Armenia]] (Eastern Anatolia) toward the [[Russian Empire]], especially toward the newly established Armenian provinces of the empire.

Anatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia, as well as a large part of its ethnic Greek population. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]], all remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has become Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Turkey}}

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Turkey}}
Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[Kızıl River]], the coastal plains of [[Çukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[Büyük Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around [[Lake Tuz]] (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Turkey}}

image:Klima_antalya.png|[[Antalya]] (southern Anatolia)
image:Klima_van.png|[[Van, Turkey|Van]] (eastern Anatolia)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Anatolia has a varied range of climates.  The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters.  The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers.&lt;ref name=Prothero19&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/19/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Sea and Marmara coasts have temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.

===Ecoregions===
There is a diverse number of plant and animal communities.

The mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia experiences humid and mild climate. There are [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|temperate broadleaf, mixed]] and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier [[continental climate]], has deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a [[Mediterranean climate]], contain [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions.
* [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]]: These temperate broadleaf and mixed forests extend across northern Anatolia, lying between the mountains of northern Anatolia and the Black Sea. They include the enclaves of [[temperate rainforest]] lying along the southeastern coast of the Black Sea in eastern Turkey and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0422|name=Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Central Anatolian deciduous forests: These forests of deciduous oaks and evergreen pines cover the plateau of central Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0410|name=Central Anatolian deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Central Anatolian [[steppe]]: These dry grasslands cover the drier valleys and surround the saline lakes of central Anatolia, and include [[halophytic]] (salt tolerant) plant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Central Anatolian steppe|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa0803}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests: This ecoregion occupies the plateau of eastern Anatolia. The drier and more continental climate is beneficial for steppe-forests dominated by deciduous oaks, with areas of shrubland, montane forest, and valley forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0420|name=Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anatolian conifer and deciduous mixed forests: These forests occupy the western, Mediterranean-climate portion of the Anatolian plateau. Pine forests and mixed pine and oak woodlands and shrublands are predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Anatolian conifer and deciduous mixed forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa1202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests: These Mediterranean-climate forests occupy the coastal lowlands and valleys of western Anatolia bordering the Aegean Sea. The ecoregion has forests of [[Turkish pine]] ''(Pinus brutia)'', oak forests and woodlands, and [[maquis shrubland]] of Turkish pine and evergreen [[sclerophyll]]ous trees and shrubs, including [[Olive]] ''(Olea europaea)'', [[Arbutus unedo|Strawberry Tree]] ''(Arbutus unedo)'', ''[[Arbutus andrachne]]'', Kermes Oak ''([[Quercus coccifera]])'', and [[Bay Laurel]] ''(Laurus nobilis)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa1201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests: These mountain forests occupy the Mediterranean-climate [[Taurus Mountains]] of southern Anatolia.

The [[Apple II series|Apple II]], also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]].

Apple began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978. In 1982, Jobs was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be sold at a reasonable price, and [[PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package.

===1986–97: Decline===
{{See also|Timeline of Apple II family|Timeline of Macintosh models}}
[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first &quot;portable&quot; Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]
The [[Macintosh Portable]] was introduced in 1989 and was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed a bulky {{convert|7.5|kg}} with a 12-hour battery life. After the Macintosh Portable, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001.

The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.

Following the success of the [[Macintosh LC]], Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, a low-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], and the ill-fated [[Performa]] line that was sold with an overwhelming number of configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as [[Sears]], [[Price Club]], and [[Wal-Mart]] (the primary dealers for these models). Consumers ended up confused and did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Macintosh Performa|url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html| publisher= Vectronics Apple World| accessdate= November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including [[QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, none of these products helped, as Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Apple saw the [[Apple II series]] as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11|title=Apple II History Chap 11|accessdate=August 12, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080912044443/http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html| archivedate= September 12, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]] with a single [[expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot; /&gt; Apple stopped selling the [[Apple IIe]] in 1993.

Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[Palm Pilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]
By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called [[eWorld]], developed in collaboration with [[America Online]] and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as [[CompuServe]]. The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| archivedate= September 24, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]]. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price.

===2007–11: Widespread success===
Apple achieved widespread success with its [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]] products, which introduced innovations in [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable music player]]s and [[personal computer]]s respectively. In addition, the implementation of a store for the purchase of software applications represented a new [[business model]]. [[Touch screen]]s had been invented and seen in mobile devices before, but Apple was the first to achieve mass market adoption of such a [[user interface]] that included particular pre-programmed touch gestures.

Delivering his keynote speech at the [[Macworld Expo]] on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would from that point on be known as Apple Inc., because computers were no longer the main focus of the company, which had shifted its emphasis to mobile electronic devices. The event also saw the announcement of the [[iPhone]] and the [[Apple TV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MW2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2007/01/mwsf/ |title= Hot News – Macworld 2007 |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Apple shares hit $97.80, an all-time high at that point. In May, Apple's share price passed the $100 mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/26/analyst.raised.aapl.target/ AAPL surges past $100, target at $140], ''MacNN'', April 26, 2007.

In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Steve Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without [[digital rights management]] (DRM) (which would allow tracks to be played on third-party players), if record labels would agree to drop the technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot;&gt;[[Steve Jobs|Jobs, Steve]].

Apple released the [[iPhone 4|fourth generation iPhone]], which introduced [[video calling]], [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], and a new [[Electrical insulation|uninsulated]] [[stainless steel]] design, which acts as the phone's antenna. Because of this antenna implementation, some iPhone 4 users reported a reduction in signal strength when the phone is held in specific ways. After a large amount of media coverage including mainstream news organizations, Apple held a press conference where they offered buyers a free rubber 'bumper' case, which had been proven to eliminate the signal reduction issue. Later that year Apple again refreshed its [[iPod]] line of MP3 players which introduced a [[multi-touch]] [[iPod Nano]], [[iPod Touch]] with [[FaceTime]], and [[iPod Shuffle]] with buttons which brought back the buttons of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/07/ipod-touch-review-2010/ |title=iPod touch review (2010) |first=Joshua |last=Topolsky |authorlink=Joshua Topolsky |work=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100901/ap_on_hi_te/us_tec_apple |title=Apple unveils new TV box for renting movies, shows – Yahoo!

It also includes web-based and [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] apps such as [[Google Maps]] and [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Weather]]. The iPhone features a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|sing=on}} touchscreen display, [[Bluetooth]], and [[Wi-Fi]] (both &quot;b&quot; and &quot;g&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;apple.com&quot; /&gt;

At [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) on June 9, 2008, Apple announced the [[iPhone 3G]]. It was released on July 11, 2008, with a reduced price of $199 for the 8&amp;nbsp;GB version, and $299 for the 16&amp;nbsp;GB version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html |title=Apple Introduces the New iPhone 3G |publisher=Apple.com |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version added support for [[3G]] networking and [[assisted-GPS]] navigation. The flat silver back and large antenna square of the original model were eliminated in favor of a curved glossy black or white back. Following customer complaints, the previously-recessed headphone jack was changed to a flush jack for compatibility with more styles of headphones. Software capabilities were improved with the release of the App Store, providing applications for download that were compatible with the iPhone. On April 24, 2009, the App Store &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/technology/06apps.html?pagewanted=all Apple’s Game Changer, Downloading Now]. The New York Times, December 5, 2009.

It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capbility, and voice control.

At WWDC on June 7, 2010, Apple announced the [[iPhone 4]], which the company describes as the &quot;biggest leap we've taken&quot; since the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/07/apple.wwdc.preview/index.html|title=Apple unveils iPhone 4, 'biggest leap we've taken' since first model|work=[[CNN]]|first1=Brandon |last1=Griggs | first2=John D. |last2= Sutter|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100708063056/http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/07/apple.wwdc.preview/index.html| archivedate= July 8, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features an all-new design, a 960x640 display, the [[Apple A4]] processor also used in the iPad, a [[gyroscope]] for enhanced gaming, 5MP camera with LED flash, front-facing [[VGA]] camera and [[FaceTime]] video calling. Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone's cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The issue was corrected by a &quot;Bumper Case&quot; distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook [[Nokia]] to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume.&lt;ref name=ftover&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward| first=Andrew| title=Apple overtakes Nokia in smartphone stakes| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4d7fd1e2-b38e-11e0-b56c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1SlYjA4IS| newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 4S]], which was released in the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan on October 14, 2011, with other countries set to follow later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osxdaily.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-availability/|title=iPhone 4S Availability|publisher=OS X Daily|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features the [[Apple A5]] processor, and is the first model offered by [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] (joining [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] and [[Verizon Wireless]] as the United States carriers offering iPhone models). On October 19, 2011, Apple announced an agreement with [[C Spire Wireless]] to sell the iPhone 4S with that carrier in the near future, marking the first time the iPhone was officially supported on a regional carrier's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2394938,00.asp |title=Regional Carrier C Spire to Sell iPhone 4S|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=October 19, 2011| first= Chloe| last = Albanesius| date= October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable feature of the iPhone 4S was [[Siri (software)|Siri]] voice assistant technology, which Apple had acquired in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/semantic-web/siri-acquired-by-apple-iphone-becomes-the-virtual-personal-assistant/371| title=Siri acquired by Apple; iPhone becomes the Virtual Personal Assistant?| publisher= [[ZDNet]]| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other features, including an updated 8MP camera with new optics. Apple sold 4 million iPhone 4S phones in the first three days of availability, making it the most successful launch of any mobile phone to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/10/17iPhone-4S-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Four-Million.html|title=iPhone 4S First Weekend Sales Top Four Million|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2012, Apple introduced the sixth-generation iPhone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/topics/870/iphone/ Statistics and Facts about the iPhone]. [[Statista]], April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[iPhone 5]]. It added a 4-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity, and the upgraded [[Apple A6]] chip, among several other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPhone 5 is World's Best-Selling Smartphone|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=February 20, 2013| first= Angela| last = Moscartello| date= February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/17iPhone-5-Pre-Orders-Top-Two-Million-in-First-24-Hours.html|title=iPhone 5 Pre-Orders Top Two Million in First 24 Hours|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html|title=iPhone 5 First Weekend Sales Top Five Million|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent filed by the corporation, published in late July 2013, revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Event Page gadgets Comment 1 inShare36 Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/?ncid=tcdaily|work=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL Inc]]|accessdate=25 July 2013|author=Darrell Etherington|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports emerged in early August that announced that Apple would be launching its next iPhone model on September 10, 2013, but further details were not available. Brian Barrett, Managing Editor of the ''[[Gizmodo]]'' publication, speculated that either an upgraded version of the iPhone 5 or a budget version will be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Apple's Next iPhone(s?)

Apple announced on September 1, 2013 that its iPhone trade-on program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stored in the US. For the program to become available, customers must have a valid contract, and must purchase a new phone, rather than simply receive credit to be used at a later date. A significant part of the program's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple stores rather than carrier stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Rolls Out iPhone Trade-In Program Nationwide|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/30/apple-iphone-trade-ins/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-main-link|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=1 September 2013|author=Seth Fiegerman|date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the launch of the [[iPhone 5S]] and [[iPhone 5C]], Apple sold over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch, which sets a new record for first weekend smartphone sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/23/225418022/apple-sells-9-million-new-iphones-in-opening-weekend|title=Apple Sells 9 Million New iPhones In Opening Weekend|publisher=[[NPR]].|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that Apple has simultaneously launched two models and the inclusion of China in the list of markets contributed to the record sales result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple polishes forecast after selling 9 million new iPhones|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/us-apple-iphone-idUSBRE98J0LD20130923|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=23 September 2013|author=Poornima Gupta|author2=Jennifer Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple TV===

[[File:AppleTV top2.png|thumb|The current generation Apple TV.]]
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]], (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and plays video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title= Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate= October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007 a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of iPod devices for the year, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Apple with the Apple TV has added another device to its portfolio that runs on its A4 processor along with the iPad and the iPhone. The memory included in the device is the half of the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third- and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|first=Ross |last=Miller|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=AOL |work=[[Engadget]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101002001956/http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/| archivedate= October 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

===Software===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[OS X]], the latest version being [[OS X Mountain Lion]] (version 10.8). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]] and [[GarageBand]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Pro]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit; and [[Motion (software)|Motion]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[iCloud]], which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by [[MobileMe]], .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.

According to Steve Jobs, Apple was so named because Jobs was coming back from an apple farm, and he was on a [[fruitarian]] diet. He thought the name was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=October 21, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion | date=September 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt; This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | date=January 4, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html| archivedate= October 3, 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html|title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff | date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Leavitt|2007|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. An [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001–2003, and a Glass-themed version has been used since 2003.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were [[The Beatles|Beatles]] fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Moses | first = Asher | title = Who was Steve Jobs the man? |work=The Age | location=Melbourne | url = http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/who-was-steve-jobs-the-man-20111007-1lcrx.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011 | date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tearful memories for Apple co-founder |work=The Age | location=Melbourne | url = http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/tearful-memories-for-apple-cofounder-2675550.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Apple Inc. had trademark issues with [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]], a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1967, involving their name and logo. This resulted in a [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer|series of lawsuits]] and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.

Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] to the more modern '[[Get a Mac]]' adverts, Apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though its [[Apple Inc. advertising#Criticism|advertising was criticized]] for the claims made by some later campaigns, particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devproconnections.com/article/apple/bbb-tells-apple-to-halt-misleading-ads.aspx|title=BBB Tells Apple to Halt Misleading Ads|publisher=DevPro|date=March 29, 2004|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3797261.stm|title=Apple Power Mac ads 'misleading' |work=BBC News | date=June 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|title=UK watchdog clears Apple ads|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080110012153/http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|archivedate=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iPhone ads in Britain.

Apple's [[brand loyalty]] is considered unusual for any product. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. Apple evangelist [[Guy Kawasaki]] has called the brand fanaticism &quot;something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Huba, Jackie; McConnell, Ben|url=http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp|title=The father of evangelism marketing|publisher=Church of the Customer|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of [[Macintosh User Group|Mac User Groups]] in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.

Mac users would meet at the European [[Apple Expo]] and the San Francisco [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo]] trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, Apple does not have official representation there. Mac developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]].

[[Apple Store]] openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/12/61513 |title=Apple Store: Chain of Devotion |work=Wired |author=Kahney, Leander |date=December 10, 2003 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York City [[Fifth Avenue]] &quot;Cube&quot; store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/fifth_avenue/index.html |title=ifo Apple Store – Fifth Avenue Grand Opening |publisher=Ifoapplestore.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ginza]] opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple in Osaka: another huge opening|url=http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|publisher=JapanConsuming|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528200249/http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|archivedate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since adopted [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as USB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-spec7.html |title=Standards and specs: The ins and outs of USB |publisher=IBM |date=April 26, 2005 |author=Seebach, Peter |accessdate=November 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101108030849/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-spec7.html| archivedate= November 8, 2010| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html|title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the first Apple Store opened, Apple has sold third-party accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/20retail.html |title=Apple Marks Second Anniversary of Retail Stores |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, at one point [[Nikon]] and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] digital cameras were sold inside the store.

Books from [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], who publishes the [[For Dummies]] series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however. The publisher's line of books were banned from Apple Stores in 2005 because Steve Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs biography, ''[[iCon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, Katie: [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/technology/30apple.html Steve Jobs's Review of His Biography: Ban It], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of the [[iBooks]]tore, Apple stopped selling physical books, both online and at the Apple Retail Stores.

===Headquarters===

[[File:Apple Headquarters in Cupertino.jpg|right|thumb|Company headquarters on [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]] in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], California]]
Apple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of [[Silicon Valley]], at 1–6 [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], California. This Apple campus has six buildings that total {{convert|850000|ft2|m2}} and was built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/10/03/story4.html | first=Sharon | last=Simonson | title=Apple gobbles up Cupertino office space | date=October 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} assembled from various contiguous plots (east of N Wolfe Road between Pruneridge Avenue and Vallco Parkway). Later acquisitions increased this to 175 acres. The new campus, also in Cupertino, will be about {{convert|1|mi}} east of the current campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Bay Area: Apple Inc | work = traveldk.com | publisher = Dorling Kindersley Limited | url = http://traveldk.com/san-francisco/bay-area/member/apple-inc | accessdate =May 7, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080618233109/http://traveldk.com/san-francisco/bay-area/member/apple-inc| archivedate= June 18, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new campus building will be designed by [[Norman Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Apple's New Headquarters Will Be Designed by Norman Foster Read more: Apple's New Headquarters to be Designed by Norman Foster | work=Inhabitat | url= http://inhabitat.com/apples-new-headquarters-will-be-designed-by-norman-foster/ | accessdate =June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2011, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building (with a café for 3,000 sitting people integrated) surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure). There will be additional buildings such as an auditorium, R&amp;D facilities, a fitness center and a dedicated generating plant as primary source of electricity (powered by natural gas and other more environmentally sound means).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Corporate culture===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a [[corporate culture]] should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]]. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like [[IBM]] by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|&quot;1984&quot; TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/| archivedate= December 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.&lt;ref name=Fortune1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup|title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ. This was especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a &quot;directly responsible individual,&quot; or &quot;DRI&quot; in Apple jargon.&lt;ref name=Fortune1/&gt; As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Maps (application)|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Inside Apple's major shakeup|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous employees of Apple have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having best-in-class employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] who was Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores (which is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO [[Tim Cook]] who has a background in supply-chain management). This is the opposite of [[General Electric]]'s corporate culture which has created well-rounded managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Tim Cook]] who joined the company in 1998 and ascended to his present position as CEO, Apple has developed an extremely efficient and effective supply chain which has been ranked as the world's best for the four years 2007–2010.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories; Apple's profit margins have been 40 percent compared with 10–20 percent for most other hardware companies in 2011. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational edge is “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.&lt;ref name=supply/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed &amp;#124; Smart Shift &amp;#124; Executive &amp;#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company previously advertised its products as being made in America up to the late 1990s, however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now done abroad. According to a report by the [[New York Times]], Apple insiders &quot;believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Charles | last1=Duhigg | first2=Keith | last2=Bradsher | title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class | date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other major US companies, Apple has a relatively simple compensation policy for executives, which does not include perks that other CEOs enjoy such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft. The company usually grants stock options to executives every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906|title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011|date=Dec. 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
{{Main|Apple Inc. litigation}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and, like its competitors and peers, engages in litigation (trying legal cases before the courts) in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons. In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests.

Some examples include [[Apple v. Samsung]], [[Apple v. Microsoft]], [[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.|Motorola v. Apple]], [[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]].

===Finance===
In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues – a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion – and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves. Apple achieved these results while losing market share in certain product categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6a7cac22-31db-11e1-9be2-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1iGo2qA2S |title=Apple in race to keep ahead in 2012 |date=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.&lt;ref name=dividendfaq&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|title=FAQ: Apple's Dividend|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/faq-apples-dividend/2012/03/20/gIQAVxMgPS_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop|accessdate=March 21, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate change and clean energy====

On April 21, 2011, [[Greenpeace]] released a report highlighting the fact that data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. [[Phil Radford]] of Greenpeace said “we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirty Data Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/Cool%20IT/dirty-data-report-greenpeace.pdf|title=Dirty Data Report Card|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, 2012, following a Greenpeace protest of Apple, Apple Inc. released a statement committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% clean energy.&lt;ref name=&quot; After Greenpeace Protests, Apple Promises to Dump Coal Power &quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Wired Magazine]] |url= http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/apple_coal/|title= After Greenpeace Protests, Apple Promises to Dump Coal Power|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Powering Our Facilities with Clean, Renewable Energy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Wired Magazine]] |url= http://www.apple.com/environment/renewable-energy/|title= Powering Our Facilities with Clean, Renewable Energy |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Apple announced it was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers, and overall 75% of its power comes from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter Burrows |title=Apple Says Data Centers Now Use 100% Renewable Energy |publisher=Business Week |date=March 21, 2013 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-21/apple-says-data-centers-now-use-100-percent-renewable-energy|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category &quot;Striding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon&quot;, adding that Apple at the time was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Apple computers also have EPEAT Gold status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-environmental-news&quot; /&gt;

In October 2011, Chinese authorities ordered an Apple supplier to close part of its plant in Suzhou after residents living nearby raised significant environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2117645/china-apple-supplier-plant-closure-environmental-concerns |title=China orders Apple supplier plant closure over environmental concerns- The Inquirer mobile |publisher=M.theinquirer.net |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Apple featured in [[Greenpeace]]'s Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how &quot;green&quot; their products are. The company ranked 4th out of 15 electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace praises Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot; /&gt; In January 2012, Apple announced plans and requested that their cable maker Volex begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ash|title=Apple Power Cables to Become Even More Environmentally Friendly|url=http://www.keynoodle.com/apple-power-cables-to-become-even-more-environmentally-friendly/|publisher=KeyNoodle|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to the ''New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the &quot;[[Double Irish arrangement#Dutch sandwich|Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich]],&quot; which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Duhigg, Charles (April 29, 2012)[ &quot;How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes.&quot;] ''New York Times.''

He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[Coca-Cola]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebrahimi|first=Helia|title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aberdeenshire''' ({{lang-gd|Siorrachd Obar Dheathain}}) is one of the 32 [[Council areas of Scotland|council areas]] of Scotland, and a [[lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]].

The present day Aberdeenshire council area does not include the [[City of Aberdeen]], now a separate council area, from which its name derives. Together, the modern council area and the city formed historic Aberdeenshire – one of the [[counties of Scotland]] formerly used for local government purposes. Within these borders, the [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|'''County of Aberdeen''']] remains in existence as a [[registration county]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ros.gov.uk/pdfs/map.pdf Land Register Counties &amp; Operational Dates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in [[Aberdeen]]; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outwith its area's border. Aberdeenshire borders [[Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]] to the south, and [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] and [[Moray]] to the west.

Traditionally, it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and forestry) and related
processing industries. Over the last 40 years, the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire's economic base, and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt; since 1975, while the land covered represents 8% of Scotland's overall territory.

==History==
Aberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage. It is the locus of a large number of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, including [[Longman Hill]], [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Catto Long Barrow]] and [[Cairn Lee]]. Since [[medieval]] times there have been a number of crossings of the [[Mounth]] (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]) through present day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. Some of the most well known and historically important [[trackway]]s are the [[Causey Mounth]] and [[Elsick Mounth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Douglas Simpson]], &quot;The Early Castles of Mar&quot;, Proceedings of the Society, 102, 10 December 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&amp;#39;Elsick Mounth'&amp;#39;, Megalithic Portal, ed.

The present council area is named after the historic [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeen]], which had different boundaries and was abolished in 1975 under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. It was replaced by [[Grampian Region|Grampian Regional Council]] and five district councils: [[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]], [[Kincardine and Deeside]], [[Moray]] and the [[City of Aberdeen]]. Local government functions were shared between the two levels. In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area, with the other two districts becoming autonomous council areas.

==Demographics==
The council area has a population of approximately 247,600,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Profile 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 4.7% of Scotland's total, a rise of over 50% from 1971. Aberdeenshire's population has grown steadily over recent years, increasing by 9.1% since 2001. Over this period Scotland's population grew by 3.8%.
The population currently has a relatively high proportion of under 16s and slightly less people of working-age compared with the Scottish average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt; The twelve biggest settlements in Aberdeenshire (with 2011 population estimates) are:

==Economy==
Aberdeenshire's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at £3,496m (2011), representing 5.2% of the Scottish total. Aberdeenshire's economy is closely linked to Aberdeen City's (GDP £7,906m) and in 2011 the region as a whole was calculated to contribute 16.8% of Scotland's GDP. Between 2012 and 2014 the combined Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City economic forecast GDP growth rate is 6.8%, the highest growth rate of any local council area and above the Scottish rate of 4.8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

A significant proportion of Aberdeenshire's working residents commute to Aberdeen City for work, varying from 11.5% from Fraserburgh to 65% from Westhill.

Average Gross Weekly Earnings (for full-time employees employed in work places in Aberdeenshire in 2011) are £570.60. This is lower than the Scottish average by £4.10 and a fall of 2.6% on the 2010 figure. The average gross weekly pay of people resident in Aberdeenshire is much higher, at £641.90, as many people commute out
of Aberdeenshire, principally into Aberdeen City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

Total employment (excluding farm data) in Aberdeenshire is estimated at 93,700 employees (Business Register and
Employment Survey 2009). The majority of employees work within the service sector, predominantly in public administration, education and health. Almost 19% of employment is within the public sector. Aberdeenshire's economy remains closely linked to Aberdeen City's and the North Sea oil industry, with many employees in oil related jobs.

The average monthly unemployment (claimant count) rate for Aberdeenshire in 2011 was 1.5%. This is lower than the average rates for Aberdeen City (2.3%), Scotland (4.2%) and the UK (3.8%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

==Major Industries==
'''Energy''' – There is significant energy related infrastructure, presence and expertise in Aberdeenshire. Peterhead is an important centre for the energy industry. Peterhead Port, which includes an extensive new quay with adjacent lay down area at Smith Quay, is a major support location for North Sea oil and gas exploration and production and the fast growing global subsea sector. The Gas Terminal at St Fergus handles around 15% of the UK's natural gas requirements and the Peterhead power station is looking to host the UK's first carbon capture and storage power generation project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

'''Fishing''' – Aberdeenshire is Scotland's foremost fishing area. In 2010, catches landed at Aberdeenshire's ports accounted for over half the total fish landings of Scotland, and almost 45% in the UK. Peterhead and Fraserburgh ports, alongside Aberdeen City, provide much of the employment in these sectors.

'''Agriculture''' – Aberdeenshire is rich in arable land, with an estimated 9,000 people employed in the sector, and is best known for rearing livestock.

'''Tourism''' – this sector continues to grow, with a range of sights to be seen in the area. From the lively Cairngorm Mountain range, to the bustling fishing ports on the North-east coast, Aberdeenshire samples a bit of everything. Aberdeenshire also has rugged coastline to complete many sandy beaches, and is a hot spot for tourist activity throughout the year. Almost 1.3 million tourists visited the region in 2011 – up 3% on the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;AberdeenshireProfile2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Profile 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and politics==
The council has 68 [[councillor]]s, elected in 19 multi-member wards by [[Single Transferable Vote]]. The 2012 elections resulted in the following representation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Local Election Results|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/elections/local/|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aztlan Underground''' is a fusion band from [[Los Angeles]]. Since early 1989, [[Aztlan]] Underground has played [[Rapcore]]. Indigenous drums, flutes, and rattles are commonplace in its musical compositions.

This unique sound is the backdrop for the band's message of dignity for indigenous people, all of humanity, and Earth. Aztlan Underground has been cultivating a grass roots audience across the country, which has become a large and loyal underground following. Their music includes spoken word pieces and elements of punk, hip hop, rock, funk, jazz, and indigenous music, among others.

The artists are Chenek &quot;DJ Bean&quot; (turntables, samples and percussion), Yaotl (vocals, indigenous percussion), Joe &quot;Peps&quot; (bass, rattles), Alonzo Beas (guitars, synth), Caxo (drums, indigenous percussion), and Bulldog (vocals, flute).

Aztlan Underground appeared on television on [[Culture Clash (TV series)|Culture Clash]] on Fox in 1993, was part of ''Breaking Out'', a concert on pay per view in 1998, and was featured in the independent films ''Algun Dia'' and ''Frontierlandia''.

The band has been mentioned or featured in various newspapers and magazines: the [[Vancouver Sun]], [[Northshore News]] (Vancouver, Canada newspaper), [[New Times LA|New Times]] (Los Angeles weekly entertainment newspaper), BLU Magazine (underground hip hop magazine), [[BAM Magazine]] (Southern California), [[La Banda Elastica Magazine]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar section. It is also the subject of a chapter in ''It's Not About A Salary'', by Brian Cross. They also opened for [[Rage Against the Machine]] in Mexico City.

It was nominated in the New Times 1998 &quot;Best Latin Influenced&quot; category, the BAM Magazine 1999 &quot;Best Rock en Español&quot; category, and the [[LA Weekly]] 1999 &quot;Best Hip Hop&quot; category.

Aztlan Underground were signed to a Basque record label in 1999 which enabled them to tour Spain extensively and perform in France and Portugal.

Other parts of the world that Aztlan Underground have performed include Canada, Australia, and Venezuela.

The band completed their third album and released it exclusively digital on August 29, 2009. The band is set to begin writing a new record this year.

Aztlan Underground were nominated for four Native American Music Award categories for the Nammys 2010. See Nammys.com

{{Campaignbox American Civil War}}

The '''American Civil War''', also known as the '''War Between the States''' or simply the '''Civil War''' (see [[Naming the American Civil War|naming]]), was a [[civil war]] fought from 1861 to 1865 in the United States after several&lt;ref&gt;Seven states originally formed the Confederacy. Four more states officially joined after formation (making 11). The Confederacy recognized as members two additional states with less formal declarations.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern [[slave states]] declared their [[secession]] and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] (the &quot;Confederacy&quot; or the &quot;[[Southern United States|South]]&quot;). The states that remained were known as the &quot;[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]&quot; or the &quot;[[Northern United States|North]]&quot;. The [[Origins of the American Civil War|war had its origin]] in the fractious issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], especially the extension of slavery into the western territories.&lt;ref&gt;Territories are organized areas that could potentially become states.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign powers did not intervene. After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], opposed the expansion of slavery into [[Territories of the United States|United States' territories]]. Lincoln won, but before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]] on March 4, 1861, seven slave states with cotton-based economies formed the Confederacy. Outgoing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[James Buchanan]] and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|Lincoln's inaugural address]] declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. A [[Peace Conference of 1861|peace conference]] failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on &quot;[[King Cotton]]&quot; that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.

Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] and established a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], dissuading [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;diplomacy&quot;/&gt; Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;proclamation&quot;/&gt; To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S. Grant's]] command of all Union armies in 1864. In the Western Theater, [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] drove east to capture [[Atlanta in the American Civil War|Atlanta]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|marched to the sea]], destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight [[Battle of attrition|battles of attrition]] through the [[Overland Campaign]] towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865. All Confederate generals surrendered by that summer.

The American Civil War was one of the earliest true [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed [[World War I]]. It remains the deadliest war in [[History of the United States|American history]], resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers&lt;ref&gt;A novel way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war. See {{cite journal | author=J. David Hacker | year=2011 | month=December | title=A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead | journal=Civil War History | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=307–348 | bibcode= | doi=10.1353/cwh.2011.0061 | url=//muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v057/57.4.hacker.html | accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an undetermined number of civilian casualties. Historian [[John Huddleston (disambiguation)|John Huddleston]] estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;

==Causes of secession==
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War|Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War|History of the United States}}
The causes of the Civil War were complex and have been controversial since the war began. The issue has been further complicated by [[historical revisionism|historical revisionists]], who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Bradford, ''A companion to American military history'' (2010) vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;101&lt;/ref&gt;  Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], won the [[1860 U.S. Presidential election|1860 election]]. After Lincoln had won without carrying a single Southern state, many Southern whites felt that disunion had become their only option, because they felt as if they were losing representation, which hampered their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.&lt;ref&gt;See sections below this introduction, including citations in these four: Freehling, William W., The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854–1861, pp. 9–24, and Martis, Kenneth C., &quot;The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress, 1789–1989&quot;, ISBN 0-02-920170-5, p. 111–115, and Foner, Eric.

Retrieved 2011-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}
The slavery issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with [[Republicanism in the United States]], or a state-based property system protected by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fletcher Melvin Green|title=Constitutional Development in the South Atlantic States, 1776–1860: A Study in the Evolution of Democracy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A5c0LKovqJUC&amp;pg=PA291|year=1930|publisher=U. of North Carolina Press|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was [[containment]]—to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Earl Weeks|title=The New Cambridge History of American Foreign Relations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y2zFFnaqgpsC&amp;pg=PA240|year= 2013|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; To slave holding interests in the South, this strategy was perceived as infringing upon their Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher J. Olsen|title=Political Culture and Secession in Mississippi: Masculinity, Honor, and the Antiparty Tradition, 1830–1860|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RrBb2ThDuCkC&amp;pg=PA237|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was being phased out of existence in the North and was fading in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] and urban areas, but was expanding in highly profitable cotton districts of the south.

[[image:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|148px|[[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]] whipped; the guilty overseer was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Forman-Brunell, Leslie Paris (2010) &quot;''[http://books.google.com/?id=bYE0DuIxkHIC&amp;pg=PA136 The Girls' History and Culture Reader: The Nineteenth Century]''&quot;. University of Illinois Press. p.136. ISBN 978-0-252-07765-4. This famous 1863 photo shows a victim who likely suffered from [[keloid]], according to Kathleen Collins, making the scars more prominent and extensive. &quot;Recognized as a searing indictment of slavery, Gordon's portrait was presented as the latest evidence in the abolitionist campaign.&amp;nbsp;... Abolitionist leaders such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] referred to it repeatedly in their work.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

Despite compromises in 1820 and 1850, the slavery issues exploded in the 1850s. Causes include controversy over admitting Missouri as a slave state in 1820, the [[Texas annexation|acquisition of Texas]] as a slave state in 1845 and the status of slavery in western territories won as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] and the resulting [[Compromise of 1850]].&lt;ref&gt;Gienapp, William E., &quot;The Crisis of American Democracy: The Political System and the Coming of the Civil War.&quot; in Boritt ed. ''Why the Civil War Came'' 79–123. See also Eric Foner, ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War'' (2nd ed. 1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the U.S. victory over Mexico, Northerners attempted to exclude slavery from conquered territories in the [[Wilmot Proviso]]; although it passed the House, it failed in the Senate. Northern (and British) readers recoiled in anger at the horrors of slavery as described in the novel and play ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) by [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, pp. 88–91. In Gerson, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe'', p.&amp;nbsp;68; See also Stowe, ''Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (1953), p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Irreconcilable disagreements over slavery ended the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and [[Know Nothing]] political parties, and later split the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] between North and South, while the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] angered slavery interests by demanding an end to its expansion. Most observers believed that without expansion slavery would eventually die out; Lincoln argued this in 1845 and [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|1858]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Lincoln: a very short introduction'' (Oxford U.P., 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;61. See also Foner, Eric. ''The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery'' (2010), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the South of the 1850s saw an increasing number of slaves leave the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]] through sale, [[manumission]] and escape. During this same period, slave-holding border states had more free African-Americans and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854–1861'', pp. 9–24. Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make [[Kansas]] a slave state. By 1860, the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased.&lt;/ref&gt; With tobacco and cotton wearing out the soil, the South believed it needed to expand slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene D. Genovese, ''The Political Economy of Slavery: Studies in the Economy and Society of the Slave South'' (Wesleyan U.P,. 1988). p.&amp;nbsp;244&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern states had advocates arguing to reopen the international slave trade to populate territory that was to be newly opened to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Manisha Sinha, ''The Counterrevolution of Slavery: Politics and Ideology in Antebellum South Carolina''  (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;127–8. Failing that, their 1854 [[Ostend Manifesto]] was an unsuccessful attempt to annex [[History of Cuba#The 19th century: years of upheaval|Cuba]] as a slave state. See Potter, David. The Impending Crisis, pp. 201–204.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern demands for a slave code to ensure slavery in the territories repeatedly split the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] between North and South by widening margins.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour Martin. ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (Doubleday, 1960), p.&amp;nbsp;349. As sectional divisions hardened, support for breaking up the Democratic party and secession on the issue of slavery in the territories was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in each region. Lipset looked at the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860–61. In each state he divided the counties into high, medium or low proportion of slaves. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties. the vote was only 37% for secession. (And in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was in the middle at 60%). States of the [[Deep South]], which had the greatest concentration of plantations, were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded. See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 242, 255, 282–83. Maps on p. 101 (The Southern Economy) and p. 236 (The Progress of Secession) are also relevant. See also David Potter. ''The Impending Crisis''. pp. 503–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

To settle the dispute over slavery expansion, Abolitionists and proslavery elements sent their partisans into Kansas, both using ballots and bullets. In the 1850s, a miniature civil war in [[Bleeding Kansas]] led pro-South Presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]] to attempt a forced admission of Kansas as a slave state. The 1857 Congressional rejection of the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]] was the first multi-party solid-North vote, and that solid vote was anti-slavery to support the democratic majority voting in the Kansas Territory.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, ''The Impending Crisis,'' 299–327.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence on behalf of Southern honor  reached the floor of the Senate when a Southern Congressmen, [[Preston Brooks]], physically assaulted Republican Senator [[Charles Sumner]] when he ridiculed prominent slaveholders as pimps for slavery.&lt;ref&gt;See Williamjames Hoffer, ''The Caning of Charles Sumner: Honor, Idealism, and the Origins of the Civil War'' (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;62, 131–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier political party structure failed to make accommodation among sectional differences. Disagreements over slavery caused the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and &quot;[[Know Nothing|Know-Nothing]]&quot; parties to collapse. In 1860, the last national political party, the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], split along sectional lines. Anti-slavery Northerners mobilized in 1860 behind moderate Abraham Lincoln because he was most likely to carry the doubtful western states. In 1857, the Supreme Court's ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]]'' decision ended the Congressional compromise for Popular Sovereignty in Kansas. According to the court, slavery in the territories was a property right of any settler, regardless of the majority there. Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney|Taney's]] decision said that slaves were &quot;so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect&quot;. The decision overturned the [[Missouri Compromise]] which banned slavery in territory north of the 36°30' parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Don E. Fehrenbacher, Don E., [http://books.google.com/?id=3KYFlabs2hQC&amp;pg=PA208  ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'']. (1981). Oxford U.P. p.&amp;nbsp;208.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A Race Meeting at Jacksonville, Alabama by W.S. Hedges - BMA.jpg|thumb|270px|Members of slave-owning [[Plantations in the American South|planter aristocracy]] dominated society and politics in the South.]]

Republicans denounced the ''Dred Scott'' decision and promised to overturn it; Abraham Lincoln warned that the next ''Dred Scott'' decision could threaten the Northern states with slavery. The Republican party platform called slavery &quot;a national evil&quot;, and Lincoln believed it would die a natural death if it were contained.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, David. ''The Impending Crisis'', p.&amp;nbsp;275.&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Stephen A. Douglas developed the [[Freeport Doctrine]] to appeal to North and South. Douglas argued, Congress could not decide either for or against slavery before a territory was settled. Nonetheless, the anti-slavery majority in Kansas could stop slavery with its own local laws if their police laws did not protect slavery introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric. 'Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War'' (2nd ed. 1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most 1850 political battles followed the arguments of Lincoln and Douglas, focusing on the issue of slavery expansion in the territories.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo, Allen C., ''Lincoln: a very short introduction'' (Oxford U.P., 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt;

But political debate was cut short throughout the South with Northern abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s 1859 raid at [[Harpers Ferry Armory]] in an attempt to incite [[slave insurrection]]s. The Southern political defense of slavery transformed into widespread expansion of local militias for armed defense of their &quot;peculiar&quot; domestic institution.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, David. ''The Impending Crisis,'' pp. 356–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's assessment of the political issue for the 1860 elections was that, &quot;This question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Speech at New Haven, Conn., March 6, 1860. The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories. See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p.&amp;nbsp;195. The Southern demand for a [[Slave codes|slave code]] for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that, &quot;our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery.&quot; See John Townsend, The Doom of Slavery in the Union, its Safety out of it, October 29, 1860. Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, whites throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery. See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans gained majorities in both House and Senate for the first time since Democrats in the 1856 elections, they were to be seated in numbers which Lincoln might use to govern, a national parliamentary majority even before pro-slavery House and Senate seats vacated.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, Kenneth C., &quot;The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in  the United States Congress, 1789–1989&quot;, ISBN 0-02-920170-5, p.&amp;nbsp;111–115. Though elected in November by the Electoral College with a plurality of popular votes, he was certified Constitutionally elected President by Congress in December before the Republican majorities were seated. Both Lincoln and the Republican Platform guaranteed no interference with slavery where it existed, and in his Inaugural Address he supported the proposed [[Corwin Amendment]] to Constitutionally restate it. But secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless. They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as [[Hinton Rowan Helper]]. Then they feared slavery in the lower South, like a &quot;scorpion encircled by fire, would sting itself to death.&quot; See Freehling, William W., The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854–1861, pp. 9–24. Besides the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners, secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation, and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Southern Vice President, [[Alexander Stephens]], in the ''[[Cornerstone Speech]],'' declared the new confederate &quot;Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia: A Biography | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | author=Schott, Thomas E. | year=1996 | location=Baton Rouge | page=334 | isbn=978-0-8071-2106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the relative weight given to causes of the Civil War by contemporary actors, historians such as Chandra Manning argue that both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] fighting soldiers believed slavery to be the cause of the Civil War. Union men mainly believed the war was to bring emancipation to the slaves. Confederates fought to protect southern society, and slavery as an integral part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eskridge |first=Larry |title=After 150 years, we still ask: Why 'this cruel war'?. |url=http://www.cantondailyledger.com/topstories/x1868081570/After-150-years-we-still-ask-Why-this-cruel-war |newspaper=Canton Daily Ledger |location=Canton, Illinois |date=Jan 29, 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-29}} &quot;The power of the federal government to affect the institution of slavery, specifically limiting it in newly added territories.&quot; was the primary political debate in Southern states over secession, rather than states' rights in general.&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the causes, [[Eric Foner]] would relate a historical context with multidimensional political, social and economic variables. The several causes united in the moment by a consolidating nationalism. A social movement that was individualist, egalitarian and perfectionist grew to a political democratic majority attacking slavery, and slavery's defense in the Southern pre-industrial traditional society brought the two sides to war.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric. [http://books.google.com/?id=rQSYk-LWTxcC Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War], Oxford U. Press, 1980 ISBN 0-19-502781-7, p.&amp;nbsp;18–20, 21–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===States' rights===
{{Main|States' rights}}
[[File:Marais-massacre.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Marais des Cygnes massacre]] of anti-slavery Kansans. May 19, 1858.|alt=Men lined up along a tree line are shot by men on horseback.]]

Everyone agreed that states had certain rights—but did those rights carry over when a citizen left that state? The Southern position was that citizens of every state had the right to take their property anywhere in the U.S. and not have it taken away—specifically they could bring their slaves anywhere and they would remain slaves. Northerners rejected this &quot;right&quot; because it would violate the right of a free state to outlaw slavery within its borders. Republicans committed to ending the expansion of slavery were among those opposed to any such right to bring slaves and slavery into the free states and territories. The ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]]'' Supreme Court decision of 1857 bolstered the Southern case within territories, and angered the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot;/&gt;

Secondly, the South argued that each state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time, that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was a &quot;[[compact theory|compact]]&quot; or agreement among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a &quot;perpetual union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot;/&gt; Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

{{Cquote|''While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson20&quot;/&gt;}}

===Sectionalism===
[[File:US Secession map 1861.svg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Status of the states, 1861.&lt;/center&gt;''' {{legend|#A40000| States that seceded before April 15, 1861}} {{legend|#EF2929| States that seceded after April 15, 1861}} {{legend|#FCE94F| Union states that permitted slavery}} {{legend|#204A87| Union states that banned slavery}}
{{legend|#D3D7CF| Territories}}|alt=Map of U.S. showing two kinds of Union states, two phases of secession and territories.]]
[[Sectionalism]] refers to the different economies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and South.&lt;ref name=&quot;sectionalism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sectionalism17&quot;/&gt; It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with subsistence farming for the poor whites. The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest (from Alabama to Texas).&lt;ref name=&quot;expansion&quot;/&gt;

However, slavery declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas (it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore, Louisville, and St. Louis), so a South based on slavery was rural and non-industrial. On the other hand, as the demand for cotton grew, the price of slaves soared. Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the [[economic determinism]] of historian [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]] in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary.&lt;ref name=&quot;progressive&quot;/&gt;

Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism.&lt;ref name=&quot;clement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;/&gt; Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing, and was prone to new &quot;isms&quot;, while the South remained true to historic [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] of the Founding Fathers (many of whom owned slaves, including Washington, Jefferson, and Madison). Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution (including the [[Northwest Ordinance]] and the [[Missouri Compromise]]) by preventing expansion of slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;february&quot;/&gt;

The issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the largest religious denominations (the [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;religious&quot;/&gt; Industrialization meant that seven European immigrants out of eight settled in the North. The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North as vice versa contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhersonExceptionalism&quot;/&gt;

====Protectionism====
{{Main|King Cotton|Protectionism#Protectionism_in_the_United_States|Infant industry|l2=Protectionism in the United States}}

[[File:NewOrleans1841AcrossRiver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[New Orleans in the American Civil War|New Orleans]] the largest cotton exporting port for New England and Great Britain textile mills, shipping Mississippi River Valley goods from North, South and Border states.]]

Historically, southern slave-holding states, because of their low cost manual labor, had little perceived need for mechanization, and supported having the right to [[King Cotton|sell cotton]] and purchase manufactured goods from any nation. Northern states, which had heavily invested in their still-nascent manufacturing, could not compete with the full-fledged industries of Europe in offering high prices for cotton imported from the South and low prices for manufactured exports in return. For this reason, northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade.

The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816. The South had no complaints but the low rates angered Northern industrialists and factory workers, especially in Pennsylvania, who demanded protection for their growing iron industry.
The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were finally enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;taussig&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor22&quot;/&gt;

Historians in the 1920s emphasized the tariff issue but since the 1950s they have minimized it, noting that few Southerners in 1860–61 said it was of central importance to them. Some secessionist documents do mention the tariff issue, though not nearly as often as the preservation of slavery.

====Slave power and free soil====
{{Main|Slave Power}}
Antislavery forces in the North identified the &quot;Slave Power&quot; as a direct threat to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. They argued that rich slave owners were using political power to take control of the Presidency, Congress and the Supreme Court, thus threatening the rights of the citizens of the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;chairmanship&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Free soil&quot; was a Northern demand that the new lands opening up in the west be available to independent [[yeoman]] farmers and not be bought out by rich slave owners who would buy up the best land and work it with slaves, forcing the white farmers onto marginal lands. This was the basis of the [[Free Soil Party]] of 1848, and a main theme of the Republican Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;republican21&quot;/&gt; Free Soilers and Republicans demanded a [[Homestead Act|homestead law]] that would give government land to settlers; it was defeated by Southerners who feared it would attract to the west European immigrants and poor Southern whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;mississippi&quot;/&gt;

===Territorial crisis===
{{Further|Slave and free states}}

Between 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Of the states carved out of these territories by 1845, all had entered the union as slave states: Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida and Texas, as well as the southern portions of Alabama and Mississippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson, 2007, p.14&quot;&gt;McPherson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; And with the conquest of northern Mexico, including California, in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to the institution flourishing in these lands as well. Southerners also anticipated garnering slaves and slave states in Cuba and Central America.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson, 2007, p. 14&quot;&gt;McPherson, 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stampp, pp. 190–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern free soil interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave soil. It was these territorial disputes that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided over.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krannawitter, 2008, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of slavery in the southern states was far less politically polarizing than the explosive question of the territorial expansion of the institution westward.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2007, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Americans were informed by two well-established readings of the Constitution regarding human bondage: first, that the slave states had complete autonomy over the institution within their boundaries, and second, that the domestic slave trade – trade among the states – was immune to federal interference.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The only feasible strategy available to attack slavery was to restrict its expansion into the new territories.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaveholding interests fully grasped the danger that this strategy posed to them.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: &quot;The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Stephen Arnold Douglas.jpg|150|John J. Crittenden - Brady-Handy.jpg|140|&lt;center&gt;Sen. '''Stephen Douglas''', author of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854|&lt;center&gt;Sen. '''John J. Crittenden''', author of the [[Crittenden Compromise]] bill of 1860&lt;/center&gt;}}

By 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories, and they all claimed to be sanctioned by the Constitution, implicitly or explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the &quot;conservative&quot;  doctrines emphasized the written text and historical precedents of the founding document (specifically, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] and the [[Missouri Compromise]]), while the other two doctrines developed arguments that transcended the Constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 21&quot;&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these &quot;conservative&quot; theories, represented by the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], argued that the historical designation of free and slave apportionments in territories should become a Constitutional mandate. The [[Crittenden Compromise]] of 1860 was an expression of this view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 20&quot;&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;

The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance – that slavery could be excluded altogether in a territory at the discretion of Congress &lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;468–469&lt;/ref&gt; – with one caveat: the [[Due Process Clause|due process clause of the Fifth Amendment]] must apply. In other words, Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 21&quot;/&gt; The [[Wilmot Proviso]] announced this position  in 1846.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 20&quot;/&gt;

Of the two doctrines that rejected federal authority, one was articulated by northern Democrat of Illinois Senator [[Stephen Arnold Douglas|Stephen A. Douglas]], and the other by southern Democrats Senator [[Jefferson Davis]] of Mississippi and Vice-President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 21&quot;/&gt;

Douglas proclaimed the doctrine of territorial or &quot;popular&quot; sovereignty, which declared that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to establish or disestablish slavery – a purely local matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 21&quot;/&gt; Congress, having created the territory, was barred, according to Douglas, from exercising any authority in domestic matters. To do so would violate historic traditions of self-government, implicit in the US Constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 23&quot;&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854 legislated this doctrine.

The fourth in this quartet is the theory of state sovereignty (&quot;[[states' rights]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestor, 1964, p. 23&quot;/&gt; also known as the &quot;Calhoun doctrine&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Varon, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt; named after the South Carolinian political theorist and statesman [[John Caldwell Calhoun|John C. Calhoun]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;470&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the Federal Union under the US Constitution – and not merely as an argument for secession.&lt;ref&gt;Varon, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise was that all authority regarding matters of slavery in the territories resided in each state. The role of the federal government was merely to enable the implementation of state laws when residents of the states entered the territories.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; The Calhoun doctrine asserted that the federal government in the territories was only the agent of the several sovereign states, and hence incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. State sovereignty, in other words, gave the laws of the slaveholding states ''extra-jurisdictional'' effect.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 2004, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;States' rights&quot; was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Thomas L. Krannawitter points out, &quot;[T]he Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Krannawitter, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gara, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;190&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, these four doctrines comprised the major ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery, the territories and the US Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, 1964, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National elections===
Beginning in the American Revolution and accelerating after the War of 1812, the people of the United States grew in their sense of country as an important example to the world of a national republic of political liberty and personal rights. Previous regional independence movements such as the Greek revolt in the Ottoman Empire, division and redivision in the Latin American political map, and the British-French Crimean triumph leading to an interest in redrawing Europe along cultural differences, all conspired to make for a time of upheaval and uncertainty about the basis of the nation-state. In the world of 19th century self-made Americans, growing in prosperity, population and expanding westward, &quot;freedom&quot; could mean personal liberty or property rights. The unresolved difference would cause failure—first in their political institutions, then in their civil life together.

====Nationalism and honor====
[[File:Abraham Lincoln seated, Feb 9, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;br&gt; 16th U.S. President (1861–1865)&lt;/center&gt;|alt=Middle-aged man in a beard posed sitting in a suit, vest and bowtie.]]
Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called &quot;unionists&quot;) and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor&quot;/&gt; [[C. Vann Woodward]] said of the latter group, &quot;A great slave society&amp;nbsp;... had grown up and miraculously flourished in the heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic. It had renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized its institutional, legal, metaphysical, and religious defenses&amp;nbsp;... When the crisis came it chose to fight. It proved to be the death struggle of a society, which went down in ruins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpoint&quot;/&gt; Perceived insults to Southern collective honor included the enormous popularity  of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852)&lt;ref name=&quot;southern&quot;/&gt; and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|the actions of abolitionist John Brown in trying to incite a slave rebellion]] in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism&quot;/&gt;

While the South moved toward a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded, and rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as treason and would not tolerate it: &quot;We denounce those threats of disunion&amp;nbsp;... as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;republican18&quot;/&gt; The South ignored the warnings: Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism19&quot;/&gt;

====Lincoln's election====
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
The election of Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.&lt;ref name=&quot;impending23&quot;/&gt; Efforts at compromise, including the &quot;[[Corwin Amendment]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Crittenden Compromise]]&quot;, failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.

==Secession and war begins==

===Resolves and developments===

====Secession of South Carolina====
{{See also|Antebellum South Carolina}}
[[South Carolina]] did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state. South Carolina adopted the &quot;[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]&quot; on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution.&lt;!-- {{cite web |title= |publisher= |accessdate= |url= }} --&gt;

====Secession winter====
Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson24&quot;/&gt; They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [[Dred Scott decision]] was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union &quot;was intended to be perpetual&quot;, but that &quot;the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union&quot; was not among the &quot;enumerated powers granted to Congress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucsb&quot;/&gt; One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [[David E. Twiggs]], who then joined the Confederacy.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the [[Morrill Tariff]], land grant colleges (the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morill Act]]), a [[Homestead Act]], a transcontinental railroad (the [[Pacific Railway Acts]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4608/ |title = Profile Showing the Grades upon the Different Routes Surveyed for the Union Pacific Rail Road Between the Missouri River and the Valley of the Platte River |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1865 |accessdate = 2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confederate states====

Seven [[Deep South]] cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with [[South Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America (February 4, 1861), with [[Jefferson Davis]] as president, and a [[Confederate States Constitution|governmental structure]] closely modeled on the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].

Following the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, an additional four Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy: [[Virginia]], [[Arkansas]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of [[West Virginia]] on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861, [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] were effectively under Union control, with Confederate state governments in exile.

Among the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states, those of three – Texas, Alabama, and Virginia – specifically mentioned the plight of the 'slaveholding states' at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no mention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp Ordinances of Secession by State].

====Union states====
{{Main|Union (American Civil War)}}
Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], New York, [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]]. During the war, [[Nevada]] and [[West Virginia]] joined as new states of the Union. [[Tennessee]] and [[Louisiana]] were returned to Union military control early in the war.

The territories of [[Colorado Territory|Colorado]], [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Territory|Nevada]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Washington Territory|Washington]] fought on the Union side. Several [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|slave-holding Native American tribes]] supported the Confederacy, giving the [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]) a small, bloody civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;university&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Volunteers – Indian Troops&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Civil War Refugees&quot;/&gt;

====Border states====
{{Main|Border states (American Civil War)}}
The border states in the Union were [[West Virginia]] (which separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ([[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]]).

[[Maryland]] had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with [[martial law]] and sent in militia units from the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson25&quot;/&gt; Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by arresting all the prominent secessionists and holding them without trial (they were later released).

[[File:US Secession map 1863 (BlankMap derived).png|thumb|The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]: blue, yellow ([[Slave state|slave]]);&lt;br /&gt; The [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]: brown&lt;br /&gt;*territories in light shades; control of Confederate territories disputed|alt=Map of U.S. showing three new states, with two kinds of Confederate territorial control.]]

In Missouri, an [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)|elected convention]] on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. (''See also: [[Missouri secession]]''). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins&quot;/&gt;

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins26&quot;/&gt;

After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34% approved the statehood bill (96% approving).&lt;ref name=&quot;A State of Convenience, The Creation of West Virginia&quot;/&gt; The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties&lt;ref name=&quot;copperhead&quot;/&gt;  in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war&lt;ref name=&quot;political&quot;/&gt; engaged about 40,000 Federal troops for much of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson27&quot;/&gt; Congress admitted [[West Virginia]] to the Union on June 20, 1863. West Virginia provided about 20,000–22,000 soldiers to both the Confederacy and the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;charleston&quot;/&gt;

A Unionist secession attempt occurred in [[East Tennessee]], but was suppressed by the Confederacy, which arrested over 3,000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union. They were held without trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederate&quot;/&gt;

===Beginning the war===
{{Details|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
Lincoln's victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union in December, and six more states did so by February 1861. A pre-war February [[Peace Conference of 1861]] met in Washington, Lincoln sneaking into town to stay in the Conference's hotel its last three days. The attempt failed at resolving the crisis, but the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson28&quot;/&gt;

====Lincoln's policy====
Since December, secessionists with and without state forces seized Federal Court Houses, U.S. Treasury mints and post offices. Southern governors ordered militia mobilization, seized most of the federal forts and cannon within their boundaries and U.S. armories of infantry weapons. The governors in big-state Republican strongholds of Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;google31&quot;/&gt; President Buchanan protested seizure of Federal property, but made no military response apart from a failed attempt in January to resupply Fort Sumter using the ship ''[[Star of the West]]'', which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson28&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Steamship Star of the West, with reinforcements for Major Anderson, approaching Fort Sumter.jpg|thumb|310px|Merchant [[Star of the West]] intended to resupply Ft. Sumter. Lincoln's policy to hold federal property was unlike Buchanan's|alt=Merchant steamer, Ft. Sumter center horizon, Confederate battery smoke left and right.]]

On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a ''[[Preamble to the United States Constitution|more perfect union]]'' than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession &quot;legally void&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaugural&quot;/&gt; He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. Marshals and Judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. In Lincoln's Inaugural, U.S. policy would only collect import duties at its ports, there could be no serious injury to justify revolution in the politics of four years. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaugural29&quot;/&gt;

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterNegotiations&quot;/&gt; Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] who at that time saw himself as the real governor or &quot;prime minister&quot; behind the throne of the inexperienced Lincoln, engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterNegotiations&quot;/&gt; President Lincoln was determined to hold all remaining Union-occupied forts in the Confederacy, [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, in Florida, [[Fort Pickens]], [[Fort Jefferson, Florida|Fort Jefferson]], and [[Fort Zachary Taylor|Fort Taylor]], and in the city first passing state Resolves for Secession, Charleston, South Carolina's [[Fort Sumter]].&lt;ref&gt;Charleston, South Carolina had additional historical significance. It was the center of the earlier [[Nullification Crisis]] where the Union had faced threats of secession during the [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]] Administration. Throughout the war, Lincoln kept a portrait of Andrew Jackson over his desk at the War Department where he read army telegraph messages to stay abreast of movement and combat. See Tom Wheeler's &quot;Mr. Lincoln's T-mails: the untold story of how Abraham Lincoln use the telegraph to win the Civil War&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Fort Sumter====
{{Main|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Great Meeting Union Square.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mass meeting April 20, 1861 to support the Government at Washington's equestrian statue in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] NYC|alt=Crowd surrounding an equestrian statue toped by a huge U.S. flag.]]

Ft. Sumter was located in the middle of the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Charleston]], SC where the U.S. forts garrison had withdrawn to avoid incidents with local militias in the streets of the city. Unlike Buchanan who allowed commanders to relinquish possession to avoid bloodshed, Lincoln required Maj. Anderson to hold on until fired upon. Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort. Anderson gave a conditional reply which the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. Troops under Beauregard bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12–13, forcing its capitulation. On April 15, Lincoln's Secretary of War then called on Governors for [[75,000 volunteers]] to recapture the fort and other federal property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lincoln's Call to Arms&quot;/&gt;

Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lincoln's Call for Troops&quot;/&gt; citing presidential powers given by the [[Militia Acts of 1792]]. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for [[75,000 volunteers]] for 90&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson30&quot;/&gt; Several Northern governors began to move forces the next day, and Secessionists seized [[Liberty Arsenal]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]] the next week.&lt;ref name=&quot;google31&quot;/&gt; Two weeks later, on May 3, 1861, Lincoln called for an additional 42,034 volunteers for a period of three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proclamation 83 – Increasing the Size of the Army and Navy&quot;/&gt;

Four states in the middle and upper South had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, but now [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson32&quot;/&gt; {{clear}}

==The War==
{{See also|List of American Civil War battles|Military leadership in the American Civil War}}
The Civil War was a contest marked by the ferocity and frequency of battle. Over four years, 237 named battles were fought, and many more minor actions and skirmishes. In the scales of world military history, both sides fighting were characterized by their bitter intensity and high casualties. &quot;The American Civil War was to prove one of the most ferocious wars ever fought&quot;. Without geographic objectives, the only target for each side was the enemy's soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, &quot;The American Civil War&quot;, p.73. Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee. See Gabor Boritt, ed. ''War Comes Again'' (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;247.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}

===Mobilization===
As the first seven states began organizing a Confederacy in Montgomery, the entire US army numbered 16,000, however Northern governors had begun to mobilize their militias.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;With an actual strength of 1,080 officers and 14,926 enlisted men on June 30, 1860, the Regular Army&amp;nbsp;...&quot; [http://www.history.army.mil/html/bookshelves/resmat/civil_war/extracts/the_civil_war_1861_(pg_199-221).pdf'|Civil War Extracts] p.&amp;nbsp;199–221, American Military History.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate Congress authorized the new nation up to 100,000 troops sent by governors as early as February in the opinion of historian E. Merton Coulter. After Fort Sumter, Lincoln called out [[75,000 three-month volunteers]], by May Jefferson Davis was pushing for 100,000 men under arms for one year or the duration, and that was answered in kind by the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, E. Merton, &quot;Confederate States of America&quot;, p.308. Accounts of historians differ as to the date and the agency of the Confederate 100,000-man call.

In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law—[[conscription]]—as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;questia&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. European [[History of Immigration to the United States#Immigration 1790 to 1849|immigrants]] joined the [[Union Army]] in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Bernhardt Faust, ''[[The German Element in the United States]]'' (1909) [http://books.google.com/?id=4xgOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA523 v. 1, p. 523 online].

When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City in July 1863]] involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote, not realizing it made them liable for the draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;reconstruct&quot;/&gt;  Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.&lt;ref name=&quot;murdock&quot;/&gt;

North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular. An estimated 120,000 men evaded conscription in the North, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 Northern soldiers deserted during the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;infantry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; along with at least 100,000 Southerners, or about 10% all together.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederate36&quot;/&gt; However, desertion was a very common event in the 19th century; in the peacetime Army about 15% of the soldiers deserted every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;peacetime&quot;/&gt; In the South, many men deserted temporarily to take care of their families,&lt;ref name=&quot;teachinghistory&quot;/&gt; then returned to their units.&lt;ref name=&quot;desertion&quot;/&gt;  In the North, &quot;bounty jumpers&quot; enlisted to get the generous bonus, deserted, then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus; 141 were caught and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;desertion37&quot;/&gt;

By 1865, the soldiers of the Union and Confederacy had grown to be the &quot;largest and most efficient armies in the world&quot;. European observers dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional, but a modern military historian's assessment is that each outmatched the French, Prussian and Russian armies of the time, and but for the Atlantic, would have threatened any of them with defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John. ''The American Civil War: a military history''. 2009. ISBN 978-0-307-26343-8, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motivation====
Perman and Taylor (2010) say that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:
:&quot;Some historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons  to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, that no matter what a soldier thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes altered his reasons for continuing the fight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Perman and Amy Murrell Taylor, eds.|title=Major Problems in the Civil War and Reconstruction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rPbZT_hrncC&amp;pg=PA177|year= 2010|publisher=Cengage |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval war===
The small U.S. Navy of 1861 was rapidly enlarged to 6,000 officers and 45,000 men in 1865, with 671 vessels, having a tonnage of 510,396.&lt;ref&gt;American Seamen's Friend Society (1865). [http://books.google.com/?id=u4gfAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA152  ''The sailors' magazine and seamen's friend'']. p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker (2010).

ABC-CLIO. p.&amp;nbsp;462.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its mission was to blockade Confederate ports, take control of the river system, defend against Confederate raiders on the high seas, and be ready for a possible war with the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Canney (1998). [http://books.google.com/?id=o_fB_SD5QhIC  ''Lincoln's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization, 1861–65'']. Naval Institute Press. p.&amp;nbsp;??.&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, the main riverine war was fought in the West, where a series of major rivers gave access to the Confederate heartland, if the U.S. Navy could take control. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.

====Union blockade====
{{Main|Union blockade}}

[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|General Scott's &quot;[[Anaconda Plan]]&quot; 1861. Tightening naval blockade, rebels out of Missouri along Mississippi River, Kentucky Unionists sit on the fence, idled cotton industry illustrated in Georgia|alt=A cartoon map of the South surrounded by a snake.]]
By early 1861, General [[Winfield Scott]] had devised the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Richter|title=The A to Z of the Civil War and Reconstruction|url=http://books.google.com/?id=obFt-MmS6ygC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott argued that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln adopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day volunteers. Public opinion however demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.&lt;ref name=&quot;winfield&quot;/&gt;

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake it was too late. &quot;King Cotton&quot; was dead, as the South could export less than 10% of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''By Sea and by river'', p.&amp;nbsp;288–289, 296–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Modern navy evolves=====
The Civil War prompted the industrial revolution and subsequently many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the [[ironclad warship]]. It began when the Confederacy knowing they had to meet or match the Unions naval superiority,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nelson2005|Nelson, 2005]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries. Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating &quot;ram fever&quot; among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority, and their own ironclad warships they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''By Sea and by river'', p.&amp;nbsp;300&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy experimented with a [[CSS Hunley|submarine]], but it did not work well,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald F. Teaster and Linda and James Treaster Ambrose, ''The Confederate Submarine H. L. Hunley'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and with building an ironclad ship, the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] based on rebuilding a sunken Union ship the ''Merrimac''. On its first foray on March 8, 1862, the ''Virginia'' decimated the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]  showed up to challenge it. The [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Battle of the Ironclads]] was a draw, but it marks the worldwide transition to ironclad warships.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nelson2005|Nelson, 2005]], pp. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy lost the ''Virginia'' when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''. Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fuller|Fuller, 2008]], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Blockade runners=====
{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}
British investors built small, very fast, steam-driven [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runner]]s that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Britain through Bermuda, Cuba, and the Bahamas in return for high-priced cotton. The ships were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out. When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a [[Prize of war]] and sold with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released.&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Neely, Jr. &quot;The Perils of Running the Blockade: The Influence of International Law in an Era of Total War,&quot; ''Civil War History'' (1986) 32#2, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–118 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v032/32.2.neely.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war. There were multiple reasons for the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies. Historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy. However, Wise argues that they provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Economic impact=====
Surdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of very few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were very scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Surdam, &quot;The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered,&quot; ''Naval War College Review'' (1998) 51#4, pp.&amp;nbsp;85–107&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade; they simply stopped calling at Confederate ports.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

To fight an offensive war the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchants ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, &quot;By Sea and by river&quot;. p.300&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15 million in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=http://books.google.com/?id=TFyLOUrdGFwC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rivers====
The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes. McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond. Ohio forces were to advance through Kentucky into Tennessee, the Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River, and the westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;Bern Anderson, ''By Sea and by river'', p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Clashes on the rivers were melees of ironclads, cottonclads gunboats and rams, complicated by torpedoes and fire rafts]]

[[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's &quot;Gilbraltar of the West&quot; at Columbus, Kentucky. Grant was rebuffed at Belmont, but cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky in March 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Whitsell, &quot;Military and Naval Activity between Cairo and Columbus,&quot; ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society'' (1963) 62#2, pp.&amp;nbsp;107–121&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action.&lt;ref&gt;Myron J. Smith, ''Tinclads in the Civil War: Union Light-Draught Gunboat Operations on Western Waters, 1862–1865'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; They took control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers after victories at [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]], and supplied Grant's forces as he moved into Tennessee. At [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], (Pittsburg Landing) in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederate made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed additional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won a decisive victory – the first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Allan Frank|author2=George A.

Memphis fell to Union forces and became a key base for further advances south along the Mississippi River. In April 1862, US Naval forces under Farragut ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans. Confederates abandoned the city,  which gave the Union a critical anchor in the deep South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig L. Symonds|author2=William J.

===Eastern theater===
{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}

Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], Virginia, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'',&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson38&quot;/&gt; McDowell's troops were forced back to Washington, D.C., by the Confederates under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the nickname of &quot;Stonewall&quot; because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson39&quot;/&gt;

{{double image|right|Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|220| Battle of Hampton Roads 3g01752u.jpg|220|&lt;center&gt; The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight. Union troops committed piecemeal had little effect|&lt;center&gt;Confederate ironclads at [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Norfolk]] and New Orleans dispersed blockade, until Union ironclads could defeat them&lt;/center&gt;}}

Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.

Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Wager Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],&lt;ref name=&quot;perryville&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;terrible&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson40&quot;/&gt; [[Joseph E. Johnston|Johnston]] halted his advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], then General [[Robert E. Lee]] and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson81&quot;/&gt; defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat. The [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson41&quot;/&gt; McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North. General Lee led 45,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson81&quot;/&gt; near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson42&quot;/&gt;  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson43&quot;/&gt;

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson44&quot;/&gt; on December 13, 1862, when over 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].

Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson45&quot;/&gt; in May 1863. Gen. Stonewall Jackson was mortally wounded by his own men during the battle and subsequently died of complications. Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson46&quot;/&gt; (July 1 to 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory.  Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson47&quot;/&gt; However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].{{clear}}

===Western theater===
{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}

While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson48&quot;/&gt; [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], Kentucky ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.

{{double image|right| Chickamauga.jpg|220|New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220|&lt;center&gt; The [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the highest two-day losses. Confederate victory held off Union offensive for two months.|&lt;center&gt;[[Capture of New Orleans#New Orleans takes a stand|New Orleans captured]]. Union ironclads forced passage, sank Confederate fleet, destroyed batteries, held docks for Army.&lt;/center&gt;}}

The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], Missouri, and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] captured New Orleans,&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson49&quot;/&gt; which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, prevented Union control of the entire river.

General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the [[Battle of Perryville]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson50&quot;/&gt; although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson51&quot;/&gt; in [[Tennessee]].

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]]. Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers); [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]];&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson52&quot;/&gt; and the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vicksburg]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson53&quot;/&gt; which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning points]] of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Third Battle of Chattanooga]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson54&quot;/&gt; driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi===
{{Details|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Missouri in the Civil War}}
{{double image|right|Battle of Lawrence.png|220|Wilson's Creek charge of 1st Iowa.jpg|220|&lt;center&gt;[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] captured a hotel in free-state Kansas for a day in a town of 2,000, burned 185 buildings, killed 182 men and boys&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John. &quot;The American Civil War: a military history&quot; ISBN 978-0-307-26343-8, p.270&lt;/ref&gt;|&lt;center&gt;[[Nathaniel Lyon]] secured St. Louis docks and arsenal, led Union forces to expel Missouri Confederate forces and government&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, &quot;The American Civil War: a military history&quot;, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}  
Extensive [[Guerrilla warfare]] characterized the trans-Mississippi region, as the Confederacy lacked the troops and the logistics to support regular armies that could challenge Union control.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Martin, ''Third War: Irregular Warfare on the Western Border 1861–1865'' (Combat Studies Institute Leavenworth Paper series, number 23, 2012). See also, Michael Fellman, ''Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri during the Civil War'' (1989). Missouri alone was the scene of over 1,000 engagements between regular units, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands, especially in the recently settled western counties.&lt;/ref&gt; Roving Confederate bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Bohl, &quot;A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri,&quot; ''Prologue,'' (2004) 36#1, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–51&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; and &quot;Order of the American Knights&quot; attacked pro-Union people, elected officeholders, and unarmed uniformed soldiers. These partisans could not be entirely driven out of the state of Missouri until an entire regular Union infantry division was engaged.

By 1864, these violent activities harmed the nationwide anti-war movement organizing against the re-election of Lincoln. Missouri not only stayed in the Union, Lincoln took 70 percent of the vote for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, &quot;The American Civil War: a military history&quot;, p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas south and west of Missouri saw numerous small-scale military actions which sought to control [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|New Mexico Territory]] for the Union. Confederate incursions into New Mexico were repulsed in 1862, the exiled Arizona government withdrew into Texas. In the Indian Territory, civil war broke out inside the tribes. About 12,000 Indian warriors fought for the Confederacy, and smaller numbers for the Union.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Graves, &quot;Indian Soldiers for the Gray Army: Confederate Recruitment in Indian Territory,&quot; ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'' (1991) 69#2, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Cherokee was  Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]], the last Confederate general to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;J. Frederick Neet, Jr. &quot;Stand Watie: Confederate General in the Cherokee Nation,&quot; ''Great Plains Journal'' (1996) 6#1 pp&amp;nbsp;36–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] in July 1863, General [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]] in Texas was informed by Jefferson Davis that he could expect no further help from east of the Mississippi River. Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies, he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler, along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy, a virtual &quot;independent fiefdom&quot; in Texas, including railroad construction and international smuggling. The Union in turn did not directly engage him.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, &quot;The American Civil War: a military history&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;220–221&lt;/ref&gt; Its 1864 [[Red River Campaign]] to take Shreveport, Louisiana was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.

===End of war===

====Conquest of Virginia====
At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms, and railroads. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals [[George Meade]] and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) were to [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|attack the Shenandoah Valley]], General Sherman was to capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] were to operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]], and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks|Nathaniel P. Banks]] was to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama.

[[William T. Sherman|Sherman]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and [[David Dixon Porter|Porter]] pictured discussing plans for the last weeks of the Civil War&lt;/center&gt;}}

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (&quot;Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]&quot;) of the Eastern campaign. Grant's [[attrition warfare|battles of attrition]] at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson55&quot;/&gt; resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks),&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson56&quot;/&gt; kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market would prove to be the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson57&quot;/&gt; a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson58&quot;/&gt; Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson59&quot;/&gt; Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.

Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;. He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south,&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson60&quot;/&gt; increasing the pressure on Lee's army.

Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson61&quot;/&gt; to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]], it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.{{clear}}

==Diplomacy==
{{Main|Britain in the American Civil War|France in the American Civil War}}
Europe in the 1860s was more fragmented than it had been since before the American Revolution. France was in a weakened state while Britain was still shocked by their poor performance in the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson546&quot;/&gt; France was unable or unwilling to support either side without Britain, where popular support remained with the Union though elite opinion was more varied. They were further distracted by Germany and Italy, who were experiencing unification troubles, and by Russia, who was almost unflinching in their support for the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson546&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;superpower237&quot;/&gt;

Though the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson546&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;superpower237&quot;/&gt; The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton but this did not work.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson72&quot;/&gt; Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.

[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that &quot;King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton&quot;, as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson72&quot;/&gt; When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins73&quot;/&gt;

[[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as [[ambassador|minister]] to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain (who had herself abolished slavery in her own colonies in 1834).&lt;ref name=&quot;approaching&quot;/&gt;

War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|British mail steamer]] to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation—though even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.&lt;ref name=&quot;approaching&quot;/&gt;

The Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would continue to remain neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;superpower&quot;/&gt;

==Victory and aftermath==

===Results and costs===
The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for its outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]] are subjects of lingering contention today.  There is much less dispute about the results. Confederate nationalism died. American nationalism triumphed. The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty. The Freedmen did indeed get their freedom, their citizenship, and control of their lives, their families and their churches.

====Results====
Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, such as [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson75&quot;/&gt; McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy&quot;/&gt;

Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy&quot;/&gt; The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves, Britain, and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson76&quot;/&gt;

Many scholars argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Williamson Murray|author2=Alvin Bernstein|author3=MacGregor Knox|title=The Making of Strategy: Rulers, States, and War|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ld8NPYqqUnMC&amp;pg=PA235|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Sydney Reginald Welland|title=The United States: A Companion to American Studies|url=http://books.google.com/?id=X5sOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA174|year=1987|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Stephen Heidler|author2=Jeanne T.

Norton |pages=1207–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil War historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back&amp;nbsp;... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ward&quot;/&gt;

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarLeader&quot;/&gt; The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly the United Kingdom and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities.

Lincoln's naval blockade was 95% effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and the United Kingdom's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either the United Kingdom or France would enter the war.

====Costs====
The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease, and 50,000 civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsWarCost&quot;/&gt; Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker believes the number of soldier deaths was approximately 750,000, 20% higher than traditionally estimated, and possibly as high as 850,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;hacker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recounting&quot;/&gt; The war accounted for roughly as many American deaths as all American deaths in other U.S. wars combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;introduction&quot;/&gt;

Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;google82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;/&gt; About 56,000 soldiers [[American Civil War prison camps|died in prison camps]] during the War.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic&quot;/&gt; An estimated 60,000 men lost limbs in the war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/08/business/technology-when-necessity-meets-ingenuity-art-of-restoring-what-s-missing.html?src=pm When Necessity Meets Ingenuity: Art of Restoring What's Missing]&quot;. The New York Times. March 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] tactics, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Minié ball]]s and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of [[trench warfare]], a style of fighting that defined the better part of World War I.

The wealth amassed in slaves and slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied prior to the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 18, 1865) by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]].

The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South. All accumulated investment Confederate bonds was forfeit; most banks and railroads were bankrupt. Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40% of that of the North, a condition which lasted until well into the 20th century. Southern influence in the US federal government, previously considerable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;/&gt; The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

===Emancipation===

====Issue of Slavery During the War====
While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery, most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]]'s army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], not to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rQSYk-LWTxcC |title=Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War |first=Eric |last=Foner |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-19-502926-0 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric. &quot;The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery&quot; (2011). p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's decision to issue the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] angered both [[Peace Democrats]] (&quot;Copperheads&quot;) and [[War Democrats]], but energized most Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp.&amp;nbsp;506–8&lt;/ref&gt;  By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the [[1862 congressional elections|1862 elections]], but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson. p.&amp;nbsp;686&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emancipation Proclamation====
{{main|Emancipation Proclamation}}
The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves &quot;...&amp;nbsp;cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.&quot; See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p.&amp;nbsp;495. The same Congressman—and his fellow Radical Republicans—put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization. See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 355, 494–6, quote from [[George Washington Julian]] on 495. Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&amp;nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].&lt;/ref&gt; About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders — until 1865 — opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, &quot;If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot; Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented. See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 831–837. The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved south. See Historian [[John D. Winters]], in ''The Civil War in Louisiana'' (1963), referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through [[Louisiana]]: &quot;As the troops moved up to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army. They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there.&quot; See [[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, ISBN 978-0-8071-0834-5, p.&amp;nbsp;237. Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]]. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&amp;nbsp;335. This led to a breakdown of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|prisoner and mail exchange program]] and the growth of prison camps such as [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison]] in Georgia, where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease. McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 791–798.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Civil War, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement and emancipation in the United States was divided. In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that &quot;to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861. Sentiment among [[German American]]s was largely anti-slavery especially among [[Forty-Eighters]], resulting in hundreds of thousands of German Americans volunteering to fight for the Union. &quot; {{Cite journal|last=Wittke|first=Carl|title=Refugees of Revolution|publisher=University of Pennsylvania press|location=Philadelphia|year=1952}} &quot;, Christian B.

Kamphoefner and Wolfgang Helbich, eds., ''Germans in the Civil War: The Letters They Wrote Home'' (2006). &quot;  On the other hand, many of the recent immigrants in the North viewed freed slaves as competition for scarce jobs, and as the reason why the Civil War was being fought. &quot; Baker, Kevin (March 2003). &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20101019000238/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_17.shtml Violent City]&quot; ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. Retrieved 2010-07-29. &quot; Due in large part to this fierce competition with free blacks for labor opportunities, the poor and working class [[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] generally opposed emancipation. When the draft began in the summer of 1863, they launched [[New York Draft Riots|a major riot in New York City]] that was suppressed by the military, as well as much smaller protests in other cities. Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2007), ch 6.

Here are Black and White teen-aged soldiers.&lt;/center&gt;}}

At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C. Frémont]] (in Missouri) and [[David Hunter]] (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats. Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, James in  Gabor S. Boritt, ed. ''Lincoln, the War President'' pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; But only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was  enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like &quot;our last shriek on the retreat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen B. Oates|Oates, Stephen B.]]  ''Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln laid the groundwork for public support in an open letter published letter to abolitionist Horace Greeley's newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lincoln Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862 &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862, the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling, Sr. Anne Francis. &quot;Images of America: Altoona, 2001, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to [[Albert G. Hodges]], Lincoln explained his belief that &quot;If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong&amp;nbsp;... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling&amp;nbsp;... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) and Union controlled regions around New Orleans, Norfolk and elsewhere, were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=SLAVERY in DELAWARE|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/delaware.htm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-10-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071016062740/http://slavenorth.com/delaware.htm| archivedate= 2007-10-16| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; James McPherson, The War that Never Goes Away&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Emancipation Proclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Molefi Kete Asante|author2=Ama Mazama|title=Encyclopedia of Black Studies|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RcBkDlJ7qjwC&amp;pg=PA82|year= 2004|publisher=SAGE|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1864, Lincoln was playing a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made emancipation universal and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold Holzer|author2=Sara Vaughn Gabbard|title=Lincoln and Freedom: Slavery, Emancipation, and the Thirteenth Amendment|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xLbkXsn6xHAC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2007|publisher=SIU Press|pages=172–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era of the United States}}
[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|Northern teachers traveled into the South to provide education and training for the newly freed population.]]
Reconstruction began during the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 and continued to 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Hans L. Trefousse, ''Historical Dictionary of Reconstruction'' (Greenwood, 1991) covers all the main events and leaders.&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the war, the most important of which were the three &quot;Reconstruction Amendments&quot; to the Constitution which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to guarantee the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a &quot;[[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]] for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery—and prevent semi-slavery status.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) is a brief survey&lt;/ref&gt;

President Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. [[Radical Republicans]] demanded strong proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. They used the Army to dissolve Southern state governments and hold new elections with Freedmen voting. The result was a Republican coalition that took power in ten states for varying lengths of time, staying in power with the help of U.S. Army units and black voters. Grant was elected president in 1868 and continued the Radical policies. Meanwhile the [[Freedman's Bureau]], started by Lincoln in 1865 to help the freed slaves, played a major role in helping the blacks and arranging work for them. In opposition paramilitary groups such as the first [[Ku Klux Klan]] used violence to thwart these efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Hans L Trefousse, ''Thaddeus Stevens: Nineteenth-Century Egalitarian'' (2005) pp 161–238&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|&quot;Liberal Republicans&quot;]] argued the war goals had been achieved and Reconstruction should end. They ran a ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated as Grant was reelected. In 1874 Democrats took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The disputed 1876 election was resolved by the [[Compromise of 1877]] which put Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the White House. He pulled out the last federal troops and the last Republican state governments in the South collapsed, marking the end of Civil War and Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction'' (2nd ed. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 marked the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the American Civil War. Many in the American South attempted to incorporate both [[African-American history|black history]] and white perspectives. A Harris Poll given in March 2011 suggested that Americans were still uniquely divided over the results and appropriate memorials to acknowledge the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;150 Years Later Remembering the American Civil War&quot;/&gt; While traditionally American films of the Civil War feature &quot;brother versus brother&quot; themes&lt;ref name=&quot;google85&quot;/&gt; film treatments of the war are evolving to include African American characters. Benard Simelton, president of the Alabama [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], said celebrating the Civil War is like celebrating the &quot;[[Holocaust]]&quot;. In reference to slavery, Simelton said that black &quot;rights were taken away&quot; and that blacks &quot;were treated as less than human beings.&quot; National Park historian Bob Sutton said that slavery was the &quot;principal cause&quot; of the war. Sutton also claimed that the issue of state rights was incorporated by the Confederacy as a justification for the war in order to get recognition from Britain. Sutton went on to mention that during the 100th anniversary of the Civil War white southerners focused on the genius of southern generals, rather than slavery. In Virginia during the fall of 2010, a conference took place that addressed the slavery issue. African Americans from around the country participated as Civil War reenactors in the parade at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] in November 2010,.&lt;ref name=racedebate/&gt;

===Hollywood===
Hollywood's take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such film classics as ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), and ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]] (2012)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallagher&quot;/&gt;

'''Andy Warhol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔr|h|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'': &quot;Warhol&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; August 6, 1928&amp;nbsp;– February 22, 1987) was an American artist who was a leading figure in the [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]]. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes controversial artist. [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in his native city, [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives. It is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist.

Warhol's art encompassed many forms of media, including hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film, and music. He was also a pioneer in computer-generated art using [[Amiga]] computers that were introduced in 1984, two years before his death. He founded ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' and was the author of numerous books, including ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' and ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]''. He is also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement. His studio, [[The Factory]], was a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films. He coined the widely used expression &quot;[[15 minutes of fame]]&quot;. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$100&amp;nbsp;million for a 1963 canvas titled ''[[Eight Elvises]].'' The private transaction was reported in a 2009 article in ''The Economist'', which described Warhol as the &quot;[[bellwether]] of the art market&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |work=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol's works include some of the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].

==Early life (1928–1949)==
[[File:WarholaHousePittsburgh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Warhol's childhood home. 3252 Dawson Street, [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|South Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania]]
Andy Warhol (né Andrej Varhola, Jr.) was born on August 6, 1928 in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warholfoundation.org/legacy/biography.html |title=Andy Warhol: Biography |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Andrej Varhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Warhola|Júlia]] (née Zavacká, 1892–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/andysmother.html |title=Mother |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S. Andy had two older brothers, Paul (born June 26, 1922) and [[John Warhola]] (May 31, 1925–December 24, 2010).

His parents were working-class [[Lemko]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi, Ivan Pop, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ovCVDLYN_JgC&amp;pg=PA539&amp;lpg=PA539&amp;dq=andy+warhol+rusyn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eT37y70Gsk&amp;sig=e5yIWSrAucn7frTgFwdYpustIfY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ioxJTryxFIjqOe-bzLYI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBTgK#v=snippet&amp;q=andy%20warhol%20&amp;f=false], University of Toronto Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Daggett Dillenberger, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Warhol+%22Rusyn 22+biography&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hdg8TaXvF8WL4ga2g5nnCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Warhol%20%22Rusyn%22%20biography&amp;f=false Religious Art of Andy Warhol], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|UvdrwlPvPlo|Influence of Andy Warhol's Carpatho-Rusyn Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; emigrants from [[Miková|Mikó]] (now called Miková), located in today's northeastern [[Slovakia]], part of the former [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Warhol's father immigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bockris&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |title=The life and death of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=4–5 |isbn=0-553-05708-1 |oclc=19631216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Byzantine Catholic]] and attended [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]]. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born in Slovakia; [[John Warhola|Ján]] was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, [[James Warhola]], became a successful children's book illustrator. About 1939, he started to collect autographed cards of film stars.

In [[third grade]], Warhol had [[Sydenham's chorea]] (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhol.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |title=biography |publisher=warhol |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[hypochondriac]], developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Fred Lawrence |last=Guiles |title=Loner at the ball: the life of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=London |year=1989 |isbn=0-593-01540-1 |oclc=19455278}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |title=The Prince of Pop Art |publisher=Arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100707153626/http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html| archivedate= July 7, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from [[Schenley High School]] in 1945. After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study [[art education]] at the University of Pittsburgh in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in Pittsburgh, where he studied [[commercial art]].&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising. In 1949, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design.

==1950s==
During the 1950s, Warhol gained fame for his whimsical ink drawings of shoe advertisements. These were done in a loose, blotted-ink style, and figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York. With the concurrent rapid expansion of the record industry and the introduction of the vinyl record, Hi-Fi, and stereophonic recordings, [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andrew |last=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |coauthors=Simon Spence and Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=137 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol was an early adopter of the [[silk screen]] printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. His earliest silkscreening in painting involved hand-drawn images though this soon progressed to the use of photographically derived silkscreening in paintings. Prior to entering the field of fine art, Warhol's commercial art background also involved innovative techniques for image making that were somewhat related to printmaking techniques. When rendering commercial objects for advertising Warhol devised a technique that resulted in a characteristic image. His imagery used in advertising was often executed by means of applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet. This was akin to a [[printmaking]] process on the most rudimentary scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=the+role+of+silk+screening+in+pop+art&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TAm3TrvSIqT50gGi0cnPBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=blotted%20line%2C%20a%20primitive%20type%20of%20printing%20literally%20%22press%22&amp;f=false ''&quot;The blotted line, a primitive type of printing—literally a &quot;press&quot;—was, when he devised it, a way for Andy&amp;nbsp;...&quot;; Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol By Tony Scherman, David Dalton]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol's work both as a commercial artist and later a fine artist displays a casual approach to image making, in which chance plays a role and mistakes and unintentional marks are tolerated. The resulting imagery in both Warhol's commercial art and later in his fine art endeavors is often replete with imperfection—smudges and smears can often be found. In his book &quot;POPism&quot; Warhol writes, &quot;When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ue1sTYpUbdsC&amp;pg=PA362&amp;lpg=PA362&amp;dq=%22when+you+do+something+exactly+wrong,+you+always+turn+up+something%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXiyJt2-Y1&amp;sig=Zgy3AvRhfap2wOOjTpIzsR0fc6g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tu63Tu6dOsjq2QX2v9TPDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22when%20you%20do%20something%20exactly%20wrong%2C%20you%20always%20turn%20up%20something%22&amp;f=false POPism: the Warhol sixties; Andy Warhol, Pat Hackett; p 362]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33886455/ns/today-entertainment/t/warhols-dollar-bills-painting-fetches-millions/ MSNBC The Arts Warhol's dollar bills painting fetches millions 11/12/2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=the+role+of+silk+screening+in+pop+art&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TAm3TrvSIqT50gGi0cnPBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=blotting&amp;f=false Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol; Tony Scherman, David Dalton; HarperCollins, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 [[Coke bottle#Contour bottle design|Coke Bottles]],'' and ''100 [[United States one-dollar bill|Dollar Bills]]''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|civil rights]] protesters. During these years, he founded his studio, &quot;[[The Factory]]&quot; and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |title=[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The philosophy of Andy Warhol: from A to B and back again]] |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |year=1975 |isbn=0-15-189050-1 |oclc=1121125}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists like Warhol were attacked for &quot;capitulating&quot; to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception. Throughout the decade it became increasingly clear that there had been a profound change in the culture of the art world, and that Warhol was at the center of that shift.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}[[File:Warhol-Campbell Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Campbell's Soup I'' (1968)]]
As an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at &quot;[[The Factory]],&quot; Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation &quot;[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]&quot;, including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (Warhol superstar)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.

===Attempted murder (1968)===
On June 3, 1968, [[radical feminist]] writer [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and [[Mario Amaya]], art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] |location=New York City |page=79 |year=1999 |isbn=0-8109-5806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the ''[[S.C.U.M. Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Solanas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Valerie |last=Solanas |authorlink=Valerie Solanas |title=[[SCUM Manifesto]] |publisher=Verso |location=London |origyear=1967 |year=2004 |isbn=1-85984-553-3 |oclc=53932627}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Separatist feminism|separatist feminist]] tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film ''[[I, a Man]]''. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobey&quot;&gt;Jobey, Liz, &quot;Solanas and Son,&quot; ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England) August 24, 1996: page T10 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol, however, was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and [[Defibrillation|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhol.org&quot;/&gt; The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harding |first=James |title=The Simplest Surrealist Act: Valerie Solanas and the (Re)Assertion of Avantgarde Priorities |journal=[[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |month=Winter |year=2001 |pages=142–162 |doi=10.1162/105420401772990388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popism287-295&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |coauthors=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York City |year=1980 |pages=287–295 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault.

Warhol had this to say about the attack: &quot;Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television.

==1970s==
[[File:Jimmy Carter Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol and [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977]]

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm |work=BBC News | title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975). An idea expressed in the book: &quot;Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delves Broughton|first=Philip|title=The Art of the Sale|year=2012|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York, NY|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol used to socialize at various nightspots in New York City, including [[Max's Kansas City]]; and, later in the 1970s, [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |accessdate=January 6, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090107015819/http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/| archivedate= January 7, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer.

With his longtime friend [[Stuart Pivar]], Warhol founded the [[New York Academy of Art]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Andy+Warhol+pivar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-PdxTrimMdPE8QPG2JniCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Andy%20Warhol%20pivar&amp;f=false New York Magazine Jan 27, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=NOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=New+York+Academy+of+Art+pivar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WEuu7kPOSo&amp;sig=zpNCde-ssv_EqVybOvjAKQ7ZunQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EPlxTqDtH86o8AOc2tHqCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20York%20Academy%20of%20Art%20pivar&amp;f=false New York Magazine Apr 8, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the &quot;[[bull market]]&quot; of 1980s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]].

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a &quot;business artist&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;jpost&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=April 8, 2008 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol—who was uninterested in Judaism and Jews—had described in his diary as &quot;They're going to sell.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;jpost&quot;/&gt; In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as &quot;the most brilliant mirror of our times,&quot; contending that &quot;Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;jpost&quot;/&gt;

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: &quot;I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |coauthors=[[Gerard Malanga]] |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Warhol died in New York City at 6:32&amp;nbsp;am on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he had been making good recovery from a routine [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1639F930A25757C0A961948260 |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=April 13, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=Care faulted in the death of warhol |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-24/news/9112240841_1_warhol-york-hospital-gallstones&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol's body was taken back to Pittsburgh by his brothers for burial. The wake was at Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home and was an open-coffin ceremony. The coffin was a solid bronze casket with gold plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was posed holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus aethiopicus|asparagus ferns]]. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, [[Paige Powell]] dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' T-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume &quot;Beautiful&quot; into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

==Foundation==

Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate — with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members — would go to create a foundation dedicated to the &quot;advancement of the visual arts&quot;. Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission &quot;to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process&quot; and is &quot;focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warholfoundation intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/foundation/overview.html|title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Paintings===
By the beginning of the 1960s, Warhol had become a very successful commercial illustrator. His detailed and elegant drawings for I. Miller shoes were particularly popular. They consisted mainly of &quot;blotted ink&quot; drawings (or [[monoprint]]s), a technique which he applied in much of his early art. Although many artists of this period worked in commercial art, most did so discreetly. Warhol was so successful, however, that his profile as an illustrator seemed to undermine his efforts to be taken seriously as an artist.

[[Pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the &quot;Pope of Pop&quot;, turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patrick S (1986). Andy Warhol's Art and Films. UMI Research Press. p.98. ISBN 0-8357-1733-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itself—to brand names, celebrities, dollar signs—and removed all traces of the artist's &quot;hand&quot; in the production of his paintings.

To him, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter. Cartoons were already being used by Lichtenstein, typography by [[Jasper Johns]], and so on; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject. His friends suggested he should paint the things he loved the most. It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961 Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans—Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html| archivedate= August 1, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For his first major exhibition Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's Soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. The work sold for $10,000 at an auction on November 17, 1971, at Sotheby's New York.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 4 race version of the then elite supercar [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. Unlike the three artists before him, Warhol declined the use of a small scale practice model, instead opting to immediately paint directly onto the full scale automobile. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100213000309/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |title=Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol |publisher=carbodydesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–1963 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.''

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]]. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is &quot;already there 'on the surface.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php artexperts/art authentication]&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblots]] are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their [[means of production]]—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York &quot;Factory&quot;. Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's &quot;piss paintings&quot;:

{{quote|Victor&amp;nbsp;... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photosilkscreen over an oxidized copper &quot;piss painting&quot;.

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of over 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappini, Rudi (ed.) ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''. Museo d'Arte Moderna /Skira, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairbrother, Trevor. &quot;Double Feature—Collaborative Paintings, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat,&quot; ''Art in America'', September 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite negative criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them &quot;masterpieces,&quot; and they were influential for his later work.&lt;ref&gt;Fretz, Eric. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: A Biography''. Greenwood Press, 2010. ISBN 978-0-313-38056-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the large collaborations with Basquiat can be seen in Warhol's ''The Last Supper'' cycle, his last and possibly his largest series, seen by some as &quot;arguably his greatest,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillenberger2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jane |last=Dillenberger |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=2001 |pages=10–11 |isbn=0-8264-1334-X |oclc=59540326}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by others as &quot;wishy-washy, religiose&quot; and &quot;spiritless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Haden-Guest, &quot;Warhol's Last Supper&quot; ArtNet 1999, http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/haden-guest/haden-guest8-3-99.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the largest series of religious-themed works by any U.S. artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillenberger2001&quot;/&gt;

At the time of his death, Warhol was working on ''[[Cars (painting)|Cars]]'', a series of paintings for [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol|title=Warhol: Cars|date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=April 24, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963–1964), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in Christie's, fetched $38.4 million.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

On May 9, 2012, his classic painting &quot;Double Elvis (Ferus Type)&quot; sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and [[spray paint]] on canvas) shows [[Elvis Presley]] in a [[gunslinger]] pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the [[Ferus Gallery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Warhol made 22 versions of the &quot;Double Elvis,&quot; nine of which are held in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AP|title=Warhol 'Elvis' sells for $37M; Lichtenstein, Weiwei works break own records at NYC auction|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/warhol-elvis-sells-for-37m-lichtenstein-weiwei-works-break-own-records-at-nyc-auction/2012/05/09/gIQAQQKDEU_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Warhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus some 500 short black-and-white &quot;screen test&quot; portraits of Factory visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner (1999), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol's movie was an &quot;homage&quot; to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (Warhol Superstar)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot;story&quot; while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Other important films include ''Bike Boy'', ''My Hustler'', and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'', a raunchy pseudo-[[Western (genre)|western]]. These and other titles document gay underground and camp culture, and continue to feature prominently in scholarship about sexuality and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Matthew |last=Tinkcom |title=Working like a homosexual: camp, capital, and cinema |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |location=Durham, North Carolina |year=2002 |isbn=0-8223-2862-3 |oclc=48098591}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Juan Antonio |last=Suárez |title=Bike boys, drag queens &amp; superstars: avant-garde, mass culture, and gay identities in the 1960s underground cinema |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana |year=1996 |isbn=0-253-32971-X |oclc=32548890}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Movie]]''—a film in which Warhol superstar Viva makes love and fools around in bed with a man for 33 minutes of the film's playing-time—was Warhol's last film as director. The film was at the time scandalous for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. For many years Viva refused to allow it to be screened. It was publicly screened in New York in 2005 for the first time in over thirty years.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for the [[The Factory|Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot;Warhol&quot; films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]—more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

===Filmography===
{{Main|Andy Warhol filmography}}

===Music===
In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). In 1966 he &quot;produced&quot; their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[the Rolling Stones]] albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981.  One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark | title = ''Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul'' | publisher=Da Capo Press | year = 2001 | page = 250 | isbn = 0-306-80935-4 | oclc = 46488152 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate =March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New Wave music|New Wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called &quot;[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]&quot; for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song &quot;Andy's Chest&quot;, about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the [[VU (album)|VU]] album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:
{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film ''[Basquiat'']. ... We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{Explain|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html | title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? | journal=''[[HUMO]]'' magazine | date=5 December 1995 | accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Books and print===
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed &quot;Jerry&quot; on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=December 6, 1987 |title=Art |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF133DF935A35751C1A961948260 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006 auction at Doyle New York]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other self-published books by Warhol include:
* ''A Gold Book''
* ''Wild Raspberries''
* ''Holy Cats''

After gaining fame, Warhol &quot;wrote&quot; several books that were commercially published:
* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, ISBN 0-8021-3553-6) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B &amp; Back Again)]]'' (1975, ISBN 0-15-671720-4)—according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, ISBN 0-15-672960-1), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, ISBN 0-446-39138-7), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.
* '''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in &quot;blotted-ink&quot; style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and (of course) ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.&lt;ref name=Bourdon51&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |page=51 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 a sketch of 1930s singer Rudy Vallee claimed to have been drawn by Andy Warhol was found at a Las Vegas garage sale. The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was 9 or 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-17591826 |title='Andy Warhol sketch found' in US garage sale |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''Brillo Boxes'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of [[Brillo|Brillo soap pads]]. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]. Warhol's sculpture was part of a series of &quot;grocery carton&quot; works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.&lt;ref name = &quot;365 Takes&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=2004 |page=35 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous works include the ''Silver Clouds''—helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped [[balloon]]s. A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968–1969) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bourdon231&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |page=231 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot;wife&quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his &quot;Invisible Sculpture&quot;, a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life—correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food—which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated &quot;capsules&quot;. The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=2004 |page=157 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a [[television special]] about a favorite subject of his{{dash}}[[Nothing]]{{dash}}that he would call ''The Nothing Special''. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous &quot;[[fifteen minutes of fame]]&quot; quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the &quot;Underground Sundae&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=January 6, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090116182237/http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm| archivedate= January 16, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fashion:''' Warhol is quoted for having said: &quot;I'd rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsters and Critics - Andy Warhol Biography|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Andy-Warhol/biography/|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most well-known Superstars, [[Edie Sedgwick]], aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend [[Halston]] was a famous one. Warhol's work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol himself has been described as a modern [[dandy]], whose authority &quot;rested more on presence than on words&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Walden]], ''Who's a Dandy?—Dandyism and Beau Brummell'', Gibson Square, London, 2002.

* '''Performance Art:''' Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] outfit cracking a whip. The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work.&lt;ref name=Bourdon221-225&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=221–225 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Theater:''' Andy Warhol's ''Pork'' opened on May 5, 1971 at LaMama theater in New York for a two-week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. ''Pork'' was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured [[Jayne County]] as &quot;Vulva&quot; and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as &quot;Amanda Pork&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical [[Man on the Moon (musical)|Man on the Moon]], which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].
* '''Photography:''' To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous amount of photographs of Factory visitors, friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Computer:''' Warhol used [[Amiga]] computers to generate digital art, including [[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]], which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with [[Debbie Harry]] as a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/amiga-ieeespectrum.pdf |title=Amiga: The Computer That Wouldn't Die |year=2001 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 video])

===Producer and product===
Warhol had assistance in producing his paintings. This is also true of his film-making and commercial enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he &quot;endorsed&quot; and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian &quot;Superstar&quot; and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]'' to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie, ''Dynamite Chicken'').{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In this respect Warhol was a fan of &quot;Art Business&quot; and &quot;Business Art&quot;—he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films like ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]],'' ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Waugh, Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall, Columbia University Press, New York, N.Y. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.&lt;ref name=lobel1996&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Michael |last=Lobel |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n4_v55/ai_19101783 |title=Warhol's closet—Andy Warhol—We're Here: Gay and Lesbian Presence in Art and Art History |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] |year=1966 |month=Winter |accessdate=January 5, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090115214807/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n4_v55/ai_19101783| archivedate= January 15, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Popism'', furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then more famous (but [[closeted]]) gay artists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. De Antonio explained that Warhol was &quot;too swish and that upsets them.&quot; In response to this, Warhol writes, &quot;There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true.

[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|300px|Images of Jesus from ''The Last Supper'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the Guggenheim felt &quot;indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claudia |last=Schmuckli |url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol: The Last Supper |publisher=[[Solomon R.

Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''The Last Supper'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt;

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt; although he was not observed taking communion or going to confession and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt; The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Roman Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] &quot;in the Orthodox way&quot; (right to left instead of the reverse).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt;

His art is noticeably influenced by the eastern Christian tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt;

Warhol's brother has described the artist as &quot;really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private&quot;. Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's eulogy [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: &quot;To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood&quot;.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt;

===Collections===
Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story [[townhouse]], but also a nearby storage unit, as &quot;Andy's Stuff.&quot; The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his &quot;Stuff.&quot;

Warhol's collections included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. One of his main collections was his [[wig]]s. Warhol owned over forty and felt very protective of his hairpieces which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote &quot;I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.&quot;

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a [[mummy|mummified]] human foot from [[Ancient Egypt]]. The curator of anthropology at [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inktank.fi/the-5-most-unusual-habits-of-andy-warhol/ |title=The 5 most unusual habits of Andy Warhol |publisher=Inktank.fi |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997).

Many films by avant-garde cineast [[Jonas Mekas]] have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the 1998 film ''[[54 (film)|54]]''. [[Guy Pearce]] portrayed Warhol in the 2007 film, ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'', about Edie Sedgwick's life.&lt;ref&gt;Hickenlooper, George (director).

Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job ( &quot;I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!&quot; and &quot;You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore.&quot;)

'''Alp Arslan''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: آلپ ارسلان; [[full name]]: ''Diya ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Adud ad-Dawlah Abu Shuja Muhammad Alp Arslan ibn Dawud'') (20 January 1029 – 15 December 1072) was the second [[Sultan]] of the [[Seljuq Empire]] and great-grandson of [[Seljuq]], the [[eponym]]ous founder of the dynasty. His real name was ''Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri'', and for his military prowess, personal valour, and fighting skills he obtained the name ''Alp Arslan'', which means &quot;Heroic Lion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alp Arslan.&quot; Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004. Encyclopedia.com. (September 5, 2011). http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404700163.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==Career==
Alp Arslan succeeded his father [[Çağrı Bey]] as governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in 1059. His uncle [[Tughril]] died and was succeeded by Suleiman, Arslan's brother. Arslan and his uncle [[Kutalmish]] both contested this succession. Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 1064 as sultan of [[Great Seljuq]], thus becoming sole monarch of [[Iran|Persia]] from the river [[Oxus]] to the [[Tigris]].

In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions, Arslan was ably assisted by [[Nizam ul-Mulk]], his [[vizier]], and one of the most eminent statesmen in early [[Muslim]] history.  With peace and security established in his dominions, Arslan convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son [[Malik Shah I]] his heir and successor.  With the hope of capturing [[Caesarea Mazaca]], the capital of [[Cappadocia]], he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the [[Euphrates]], and entered and invaded the city. He then marched into [[Armenia]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]], which he conquered in 1064.

==Byzantine struggle==
[[Image:131 Bataille de Malazgirt.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Battle of Manzikert]]

En route to Syria in 1068, Alp Arslan Oush invaded the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Romanos IV]] Diogenes, assuming command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the Turks were defeated in detail and driven across the Euphrates in 1070. The first two campaigns were conducted by the emperor himself, while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenos, great-uncle of Emperor [[Manuel Comnenus|Manuel Comnenos]]. 

In 1071 Romanos again took the field and advanced into Armenia with possibly 30,000 men, including a contingent of [[Cuman]] Turks as well as contingents of [[Franks]] and [[Normans]], under [[Roussel de Bailleul|Ursel de Baieul]]. At [[Manzikert]], on the [[Murat River]], north of [[Lake Van]], Diogenes was met by Alp Arslan. The sultan proposed terms of peace, which were rejected by the emperor, and the two forces waged the [[Battle of Manzikert]].  The [[Cuman]] mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkish side. Seeing this, &quot;the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Crusade|first= Steve|last= Runciman|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be exact, Romanos was betrayed by general [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Romanos IV)|Andronikos Doukas]], son of the Caesar (Romanos's stepson), who pronounced him dead and rode off with a large part of the Byzantine forces at a critical moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Byzantium: The Apogee|first=John Julius|last=Norwich|publisher=Penguin|year=1993|isbn=0-14-011448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines were totally routed.

Emperor Romanos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan. After a ritual humiliation, Arslan treated him with generosity. After peace terms were agreed to, Arslan dismissed the Emperor, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. The following conversation is said to have taken place after Romanos was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan:&lt;ref name=&quot;kings&quot;&gt;Peoples, R. Scott ''Crusade of Kings'' Wildside Press LLC, 2008. p. 13. ISBN 0-8095-7221-4, ISBN 978-0-8095-7221-2&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Alp Arslan'': &quot;What would you do if I was brought before you as a prisoner?&quot;
:''Romanos'': &quot;Perhaps I'd kill you, or exhibit you in the streets of Constantinople.&quot;
:''Alp Arslan'': &quot;My punishment is far heavier.  I forgive you, and set you free.&quot;

Alp Arslan's victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the [[Seljuq Turks]] and [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly four more centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in [[Anatolia]]. Most historians, including [[Edward Gibbon]], date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in Anatolia that had furnished the Empire with men and treasure.

==State organization==
Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm.  Domestic affairs were handled by his able vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the founder of the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military [[fiefdom|fiefs]], governed by Seljuq princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene.  This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Persians, Turks, and other established cultures within the Seljuq realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers.  He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.

According to the poet [[Saadi Shirazi]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Arslan possessed a fort, which raised at the height of [[Alwand]],{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2012}} from all were those within its walls, for its roads were a labyrinth, like the curls of a bride. From a learned traveler Arslan once inquired: &quot;Didst thou ever, in thy wanderings, see a fort as strong as this?&quot; &quot;Splendid it is,&quot; was the travelers reply, &quot;but methinks not it confers much strength. Before thee, did not other kings possess it for a while, then pass away? After thee, will not other kings assume control, and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope?&quot;''

''In the estimation of the wise, the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another.'' (the fort was sacked by the Mongols led by [[Hulagu]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Suleyman I of Rûm|Suleiman ibn Kutalmish]] was the son of the contender for Arslan's throne; he was appointed governor of the north-western provinces and assigned to completing the invasion of Anatolia. An explanation for this choice can only be conjectured from [[Ibn al-Athir]]’s account of the battle between Alp-Arslan and [[Kutalmish]], in which he writes that Alp-Arslan wept for the latter's death and greatly mourned the loss of his kinsman.

==Death==
After Manzikert, the dominion of Alp Arslan extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march for the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, [[Yussuf el-Harezmi]], a [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmian]].  He was obliged to surrender, however, and was carried as a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death.  Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan.  Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as the foremost archer of his time, motioned to his guards not to interfere. He drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died from this wound four days later, on 25 November 1072, in his 42nd year, and he was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father, [[Chaghri Beg]]. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription:

:“''O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold! He is under the black soil now''...”

As he lay dying, Alp Arslan whispered to his son that his vanity had killed him.  &quot;Alas,&quot; he is recorded to have said, &quot;surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause, guarded night and day by them, I should have allowed them to do their job.  I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense.  I forgot those warnings, and here I lie, dying in agony.  Remember well the lessons learned, and do not allow your vanity to overreach your good sense...&quot;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Legacy==
Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the [[crusade]]s.

From 2002 to July 2008 under [[Renaming of Turkmen months and days of week, 2002|Turkmen calendar reform]], the month of August was named after Alp Arslan.

The '''American Film Institute''' is a film organization that educates future filmmakers and honors the heritage of the moving picture arts.

AFI is America’s promise to preserve the history of the motion picture, to honor the artists and their work and to educate the next generation of storytellers.

The Institute is composed of leaders from the film, entertainment, business and academic communities.  A prestigious Board of Trustees chaired by Sir Howard Stringer and a Board of Directors chaired by Robert Daly guide the organization, which is led by President and CEO Bob Gazzale.  Prior leaders were founding director George Stevens, Jr. (from 1967 to 1980) and Jean Picker Firstenberg (from 1980 to 2007).

AFI is supported by private funding and public membership.

AFI educational and cultural programs include:

==History==

The American Film Institute was founded by a 1965 presidential mandate announced in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Rose_Garden Rose Garden] of the [[White House]] by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – to establish a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of American film heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work.

Two years later, in 1967, AFI was established, supported by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].

The original 22-member [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees Board of Trustees] included Chair [[Gregory Peck]] and Vice Chair [[Sidney Poitier]] as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Jack Valenti]] and other representatives from the arts and academia.[1]

The Institute established a training program for filmmakers known then as the Center for Advanced Film Studies. Also created in the early years were a repertory film exhibition program at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and the [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] — the definitive scholarly source for American film history.

The Institute moved to its current eight-acre [[Hollywood]] campus in 1981.  The film training program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], an accredited graduate school, widely regarded as one of the top film schools in the world.

AFI moved its presentation of first-run and auteur films from the Kennedy Center to the historic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Silver 1938 Art Deco AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center], which now hosts two major film festivals – AFI FEST and AFI DOCS –making AFI the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the world.

AFI continues to educate global audiences and recognize artistic excellence through its awards programs and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_10_Top_10 10 Top 10 Lists].

==AFI Conservatory==

In 1969, the Institute established the Center for Advanced Film Studies at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greystone_Mansion Greystone, the Doheny Mansion] in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]].  The first class included filmmakers [[Terrence Malick]], [[David Lynch]], [[Caleb Deschanel]] and [[Paul Schrader]].  That program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], a fully accredited graduate [[film school]] located in the hills above Hollywood, California, providing training in six filmmaking disciplines: [[Cinematography]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_directing Directing], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing Editing], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_production#Production Producing], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_design Production Design] and [[Screenwriting]].  Mirroring a professional production environment, Fellows collaborate to make more films than any other graduate level program. Admission to AFI Conservatory is highly selective, with a maximum of only 140 graduates per year.

In 2013, [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]® and [[Oscars|Oscar]]®-winning director, producer and screenwriter [[James L. Brooks]] ([[AS GOOD AS IT GETS]], [[Broadcast News (film)|BROADCAST NEWS]], [[Terms of Endearment|TERMS OF ENDEARMENT]]) joined AFI as Artistic Director of the AFI Conservatory where he provides creative leadership for the prestigious film program renowned for its collaborative approach to hands-on filmmaking with masters of the art form.

Brooks’ artistic role at the AFI Conservatory has a rich legacy that includes Dan Petrie, Jr., [[Robert Wise]] and [[Frank Pierson]]. Award-winning director Bob Mandel serves as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the AFI Conservatory, whose faculty is composed of dedicated professionals from the top of the film and television communities.

===Notable alumni===
AFI Conservatory's alumni have active careers in film, television and on the web. They have been recognized with all of the major industry awards – Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, [[guild]] awards, and the [[Tony Award]].

{{nihongo|'''Akira Kurosawa'''|黒澤 明&lt;ref&gt;黒沢 明 in [[Shinjitai]]&lt;/ref&gt;|Kurosawa Akira|extra=March 23, 1910&amp;nbsp;– September 6, 1998|lead=yes}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], [[film producer|producer]], and [[film editing|editor]]. Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Kurosawa directed 30 films&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In 1946, Kurosawa co-directed, with Hideo Sekigawa and Kajiro Yamamoto, the feature ''[[Those Who Make Tomorrow]]'' (''Asu o tsukuru hitobito''); apparently, he was commanded to make this film by [[Toho]] studios, to which he was under contract at the time. (He claimed that the film was shot in only a week.) It was the only film he ever directed for which he did not receive sole credit and the only one that has never been released on home video in any form. The movie was later repudiated by Kurosawa and is often not counted with the 30 other films he made, though it is listed in some filmographies of the director. See Galbraith, pp. 65–67, and Kurosawa's [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] page.&lt;/ref&gt; in a career spanning 57 years.

Kurosawa entered the [[Japanese film]] industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an [[assistant director]] and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II with the popular [[action film]] ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' (a.k.a. ''Judo Saga''). After the war, the critically acclaimed ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.

''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', which premiered in Tokyo in August 1950, and which also starred Mifune, became, on September 10, 1951, the surprise winner of the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was subsequently released in Europe and North America. The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded films such as ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961). After the mid-1960s, he became much less prolific, but his later work—including his final two epics, ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985)—continued to win awards, including the [[Palme d'Or]] for ''Kagemusha'', though more often abroad than in Japan.

In 1990, he accepted the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Honorary Award|Lifetime Achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100217234929/http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/ics-wpd/exec/icswppro.dll?AC=qbe_query&amp;TN=AAtrans&amp;RF=WebReportPermaLink&amp;MF=oscarsmsg.ini&amp;NP=255&amp;BU=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/index.htm&amp;QY=find+acceptorlink+%3D062-25 |title=Academy Award Acceptance Speech Database |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRiBBehTnZU |title=Akira Kurosawa Tribute with George Lucas, Steven Spielberg |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumously, he was named &quot;[[Asian of the Century]]&quot; in the &quot;Arts, Literature, and Culture&quot; category by ''[[AsianWeek]]'' magazine and [[CNN]], cited as &quot;one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/features/aoc/aoc.kurosawa.html|title=ASIANOW&amp;nbsp;– Asiaweek&amp;nbsp;– Asian of the Century&amp;nbsp;– Kurosawa Akira&amp;nbsp;– 12/10/99 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Childhood and youth (1910–1935)===
Kurosawa was born on 23 March 1910 in Ōimachi in the [[Ōmori]] district of Tokyo. His father Isamu, a member of a former [[samurai]] family from the [[Akita Prefecture]], worked as the director of the Army's Physical Education Institute's [[Secondary education in Japan#Middle school|lower secondary school]], while his mother Shima came from a merchant's family living in [[Osaka]]. Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurosawa 1983 17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa was open to western traditions and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important formative influence was his [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary school]] teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the boy also studied [[calligraphy]] and [[Kendo]] swordsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In the aftermath of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heigo was academically gifted, but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyo's foremost [[Secondary education in Japan#Upper secondary school|high school]], he began to detach himself from the rest of the family, preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurosawa 1983 17&quot;/&gt; In the late 1920s, Heigo became a [[benshi]] (silent film narrator) for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films, and quickly made a name for himself. Akira, who at this point planned to become a painter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved in with him, and the two brothers became inseparable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith IV 2002 19&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Heigo, Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=72–74, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; while exhibiting his paintings and working for the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] Proletarian Artists' League. However, he was never able to make a living with his art, and, as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as &quot;putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas&quot;, he lost his enthusiasm for painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing production of [[Sound film|talking pictures]] in the early 1930s, film narrators like Heigo began to lose work, and Akira moved back in with his parents. In July 1933, Heigo committed suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother's death&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chapter of his autobiography (''[[Something Like an Autobiography]]'') that describes it—written nearly half a century after the event—is titled, &quot;A Story I Don't Want to Tell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only four months later, Kurosawa's eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith IV 2002 19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;/&gt;

===Director in training (1935–1941)===
In 1935, the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, [[Toho]]), advertised for assistant directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, there was no way to correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director [[Kajirō Yamamoto]], who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=89–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his five years as an assistant director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but by far the most important figure in his development was Kajiro Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto, many of them comedies featuring the popular actor [[Kenichi Enomoto]], known as &quot;Enoken.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=652–658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawa's talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa's responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing and second-unit directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin|1994|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last of Kurosawa's films as an assistant director, ''Horse'' (''Uma'', 1941), Kurosawa took over most of the production, as Yamamoto was occupied with the shooting of another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin|1994|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors. This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/#writer |title=Akira Kurosawa |accessdate=2010-08-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100724065118/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/| archivedate= 24 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=658–707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime films and marriage (1942–1945)===
In the two years following the release of ''Horse'' in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, about a year after the beginning of Japan's war with the United States, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his [[Musashi (novel)|Musashi Miyamoto]] inspired [[judo]] novel, ''Sanshiro Sugata'', the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting of ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' began on location in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter. The censorship considered the work too &quot;British-American&quot; (an accusation tantamount, at that time, to a charge of treason), and it was only through the intervention of director [[Yasujirō Ozu]], who championed the film, that ''Sanshiro Sugata'' was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. (Kurosawa had just turned 33.) The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=43, 45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=124–128, 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in ''[[The Most Beautiful]]'', a propaganda film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=132–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=46–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During production, the actress playing the leader of the factory workers, [[Yōko Yaguchi]], was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were constantly at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=137–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer on some of his father's last projects, and [[Kazuko Kurosawa|Kazuko]], born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=64, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his marriage, Kurosawa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film. The often blatantly propagandistic ''[[Sanshiro Sugata Part II]]'', which premiered in May 1945, is generally considered one of his very weakest pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less expensive to produce. ''[[The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail]]'', based on the Kabuki play ''[[Kanjinchō]]'' and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the [[occupation of Japan]] had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly &quot;feudal&quot; and banned the work. (It would not be released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, ''Ikiru'', was also released.) Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and &quot;democratic&quot; (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=660–661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|2001|pp=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First postwar works (1946–1950)===
The war now ended, Kurosawa, absorbing the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards the individual and the self. The first such film, ''[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]'' (1946), inspired by both the 1933 [[Takigawa incident]] and the [[Hotsumi Ozaki]] wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie ([[Setsuko Hara]]), born into upper-middle-class privilege, who comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title (&quot;No regrets for...&quot;) into something of a postwar [[catchphrase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=70–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=114–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next film, ''[[One Wonderful Sunday]]'' premiered in July 1947 to mixed reviews. It is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy, within the devastation of postwar Tokyo, their one weekly day off. The movie bears the influence of [[Frank Capra]], [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[F. W. Murnau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another film released in 1947 with Kurosawa's involvement was the [[action film|action-adventure thriller]], ''[[Snow Trail]]'', directed by [[Senkichi Taniguchi]] from Kurosawa's screenplay. It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshiro Mifune. It was Kurosawa who, with his mentor Yamamoto, had intervened to persuade Toho to sign Mifune, during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kurosawa, but managed to alienate most of the other judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drunken-Angel-1a.jpg|thumb|[[Toshiro Mifune]] electrified audiences as a rebellious but critically ill gangster in ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), considered Akira Kurosawa's breakthrough film.|alt=Photo of the very young Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune in the late 1940s, facing left, his hair hanging over his forehead, with an intense and angry look on his face.]]
''[[Drunken Angel]]'' is often considered the director's first major work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Although the script, like all of Kurosawa's occupation-era works, had to go through forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster ([[yakuza]]) with [[tuberculosis]], it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one (''Ikiru'') of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in ''Drunken Angel'', his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by [[Takashi Shimura]], who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that [[Marlon Brando]]'s defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious [[Kinema Junpo]] critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=47–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa, with producer Sōjirō Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, [[Mikio Naruse]] and [[Senkichi Taniguchi]], formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei studios]], Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. ''[[The Quiet Duel]]'' starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with [[syphilis]], a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally considered one of the director's lesser achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=140–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second film of 1949, also produced by Film Art Association and released by [[Shintoho]], was ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]''. The most celebrated of Kurosawa's works{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} from this period, it is a [[Mystery film|detective movie]] (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective, played by Mifune, and his obsession over his handgun, stolen by a penniless young man who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, [[Georges Simenon]], it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, [[Ishirō Honda]], the future director of ''Gojira'' (aka, ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=172–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=108–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary [[police procedural]] and [[buddy cop film]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway{{!}}Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Scandal (1950 film)|Scandal]]'', released by [[Shochiku]] in April 1950, was inspired by the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese [[yellow journalism]]. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=177–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it would be Kurosawa's ''second'' film of 1950, ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', that would ultimately win him a whole new audience.

===International recognition (1950–1958)===
After finishing ''Scandal'', Kurosawa was approached by [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei studios]], which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, [[Shinobu Hashimoto]]. (They would eventually write nine films together.) It was based on [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s experimental short story ''[[In a Grove]]'', which recounts the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=127–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rashomon 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Machiko Kyō]] and Toshiro Mifune in a scene from ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950).|alt=A photo of two actors, Toshiro Mifune and Machiko Kyo, within a forest, in a scene from the 1950 Japanese film, ''Rashomon'': Ms. Kyo, a young and attractive woman, is seen in an 11th Century period kimono at left of frame, kneeling at Mifune's feet; Mifune, at right of frame, wearing the rough costume of a bandit of that period, is looking down at Ms. Kyo as she appears to plead with him.]]

Shooting of ''Rashomon'' began on July 7, 1950 and, after extensive location work in the primeval forest of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=180–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=82–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was ''[[The Idiot (1951 film)|The Idiot]]'', an adaptation of the novel by the director's favorite writer, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to [[Hokkaido]], but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today to be one of the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=144–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=135–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=190–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Kurosawa, ''Rashomon'' had been entered in the prestigious [[Venice Film Festival]], due to the efforts of Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based representative of an Italian film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, ''Rashomon'' was awarded the festival's highest prize, the [[Golden Lion]], shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Daiei very briefly exhibited a subtitled print of the film in Los Angeles, [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] purchased distribution rights to ''Rashomon'' in the United States. The company was taking a considerable gamble. It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market, and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been [[Mikio Naruse]]'s comedy, ''Wife! Be Like a Rose'', in 1937: a critical and box-office flop. However, ''Rashomon'''s commercial run, greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist [[Ed Sullivan]], was very successful. (It earned $35,000 in its first three weeks at a single New York theater, an almost unheard-of sum at the time.) This success in turn led to a vogue in America for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=137–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The film was also released, by other distributors, in France, West Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/releaseinfo |title=Rashômon (1950) – Release dates|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi (''[[The Life of Oharu]]'', ''[[Ugetsu]]'', ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'') and, somewhat later, Yasujirō Ozu (''[[Tokyo Story]]'', ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'')—artists highly respected in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|pp=35, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of Japanese filmmakers who would find acclaim outside Japan—from [[Nagisa Oshima]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] to [[Juzo Itami]], [[Takeshi Kitano]] and [[Takashi Miike]]—were able to pass through the door that Kurosawa was the very first to open.

His career boosted by his sudden international fame, Kurosawa, now reunited with his original film studio, Toho (which would go on to produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, ''[[Ikiru]]''. The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write 12 Kurosawa films. Despite the work's grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of [[Berthold Brecht|Brecht]], to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. (American pop songs figure prominently in the film.) Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. ''Ikiru'' opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo &quot;Best Film&quot; award—and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artist's films set in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=155–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=86–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=99–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1952, Kurosawa took his ''Ikiru'' screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five day secluded residence at an inn to create the screenplay for his next movie, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''. The [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] work was Kurosawa's first proper [[samurai cinema|samurai film]], the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in [[Sengoku period]] Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=170–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months were spent in pre-production and a month in rehearsals. Shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year, interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kurosawa's health problems. The film finally opened in April 1954, half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget, making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made. (However, by Hollywood standards, it was a quite modestly budgeted production, even for that time). The film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit, quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could, and did, market internationally—though with extensive edits. Over time—and with the theatrical and home video releases of the uncut version—its reputation has steadily grown. It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made, and in 1979, a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made.&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=97–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1954, nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in Japan (the only country ever to have been the victim of an atomic bombing), and one particular [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|incident]] in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to [[nuclear fallout]], with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, ''[[I Live in Fear|Record of a Living Being]]'', was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend [[Fumio Hayasaka]] passed away (of tuberculosis) at the age of only 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, [[Masaru Sato]], who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. ''Record of a Living Being'' opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=214–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin|1994|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=159–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's next project, ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', a lavishly produced adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]''—set, like ''Seven Samurai'', in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into an Asian context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, [[Isuzu Yamada]], to regard the work as if it were a cinematic version of a ''Japanese'' rather than a European literary classic. Appropriately, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director's previous film. Abroad, ''Throne of Blood'', regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=230–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Isuzu Yamada interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=142–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of ''[[The Lower Depths (1957 film)|The Lower Depths]]'', based on a  [[The Lower Depths|play]] by [[Maxim Gorky]], taking place in May and June 1957.  In contrast to the gigantic scope and sweep of ''Throne of Blood'', ''The Lower Depths'' was shot on only two confined sets, the better to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late [[Tokugawa era|Edo period]]—unlike his earlier ''The Idiot'', was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response similar to that of ''Throne of Blood''. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=239–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=149–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|pp=171, 185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=125–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's three consecutive movies after ''Seven Samurai'' had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had. The mood of the director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in ''Throne of Blood'' and ''The Lower Depths''. He recognized this,  and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new [[widescreen]] format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', is an [[Action film|action-adventure]] comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, ''The Hidden Fortress'' became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences (as [[George Lucas]] himself has conceded) on Lucas' hugely popular 1977 [[space opera]], ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=253–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=134–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Star Wars|loc=George Lucas commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of a company and the end of an era (1959–1965)===
Starting with ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa's productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the director's budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested that he might help finance his own works, therefore making the studio's potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as majority shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite now risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a story more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any of his previous works. ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'', based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man who climbs the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|U.S.-Japan Security treaty]], which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence, depicting a corporate wedding reception interrupted by reporters and police (who arrest an executive for corruption), is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=140–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=175–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (''The Bodyguard''), Kurosawa Production's second film, centers on a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the [[Western (genre)|Western]], while at the same time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by [[Kazuo Miyagawa]] (who shot ''Rashomon'') and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was an immense success at the box office, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. Critical reaction was equally positive, and the film proved a major influence on its genre in Japan, ushering in a new era of violent samurai films, known as &quot;cruel films&quot; (''zankoku eiga'').{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The movie and its [[Black comedy|blackly comic]] tone were also widely imitated abroad. [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=301–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=289–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=147–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Yojimbo'', Kurosawa found himself under pressure from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before ''Yojimbo'', reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. ''[[Sanjuro]]'' was the first of three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer [[Shūgorō Yamamoto]] (the others would be ''Red Beard'' and ''Dodeskaden''). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than ''Yojimbo'', though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing ''Yojimbo'''s box office success and garnering positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=324–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=293–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=156–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa had meanwhile instructed Toho to purchase the film rights to ''King's Ransom'', a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter [[Evan Hunter]], under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, as one of his [[87th Precinct]] series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). ''High and Low'' is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=341–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=163–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=188–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa quickly moved on to his next project, ''[[Red Beard]]''. Based on a short story collection by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevsky's novel ''[[Humiliated and Insulted|The Insulted and Injured]]'', it is a period film, set in a mid-19th century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as &quot;Akahige&quot; (&quot;Red Beard&quot;), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yūzō Kayama]], who plays Yasumoto, was an extremely popular film and music star at the time, particularly for his &quot;Young Guy&quot; (''Wakadaishō'') series of musical comedies, so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kurosawa strong box-office. The shoot, the filmmaker's longest ever, lasted well over a year (after five months of pre-production), and wrapped in spring 1965, leaving the director, his crew and his actors exhausted. ''Red Beard'' premiered in April 1965, becoming the year's highest-grossing Japanese production and the third (and last) Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawa's best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawa's best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artist's previous commitment to social and political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=374–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=171–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=235–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film marked something of an end of an era for its creator. The director himself recognized this at the time of its release, telling critic [[Donald Richie]] that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Red Beard'' also marked the midway point, chronologically, in the artist's career. During his previous twenty-nine years in the film industry (which includes his five years as assistant director), he had directed twenty-three films, while during the remaining twenty-eight years, for many and complex reasons, he would complete only seven more. Also, for reasons never adequately explained, ''Red Beard'' would be his final film starring Toshiro Mifune. Yu Fujiki, an actor who worked on ''The Lower Depths'', observed, regarding the closeness of the two men on the set, &quot;Mr. Kurosawa's heart was in Mr. Mifune's body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique &quot;symbiosis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=Donald Richie interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all critics agree that the strongest period of Kurosawa's career was the one between 1950 and 1965—bookended by ''Rashomon'' and ''Red Beard''—and that it is not a coincidence that this phase corresponds almost exactly to the time that he and Mifune worked together.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Hollywood detour (1966–1968)===
When Kurosawa's exclusive contract with Toho came to an end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his first foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story based on a [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] article. The [[Embassy Pictures]] action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply ''Runaway Train'', would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], would finally make ''[[Runaway Train (film)|Runaway Train]]'', though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=440–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project. ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', produced by [[20th Century Fox]] and Kurosawa Production, would be a portrayal of the Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from both the American and the Japanese points-of-view, with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an English-speaking filmmaker directing the American half. He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but very soon the project began to unravel. The director chosen to film the American sequences turned out not to be the prestigious English filmmaker [[David Lean]], as the producers had led Kurosawa to believe, but the much less celebrated special effects expert, [[Richard Fleischer]]. The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes—a major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968. Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to &quot;fatigue&quot;, effectively firing him. (He was ultimately replaced, for the film's Japanese sequences, with two directors, [[Kinji Fukasaku]] and [[Toshio Masuda]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=448–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tora! Tora! Tora!'', finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an &quot;almost unmitigated tragedy&quot; in Kurosawa's career. He had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. (He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again. The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company (a situation reminiscent of his own movie, ''The Bad Sleep Well''). His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he would never make another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=Donald Richie interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=458–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A difficult decade (1969–1977)===
Knowing that his reputation was at stake following the much publicised ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'' debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors [[Keisuke Kinoshita]], [[Masaki Kobayashi]] and [[Kon Ichikawa]], who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=437–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yojimbo|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create'' – Crew Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called ''Dora-Heita'', but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to ''[[Dodesukaden]]'', an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but ''Dodesukaden'' has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=474–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he would ever direct another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=487–489, 522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1973, the Soviet studio [[Mosfilm]] approached the filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer [[Vladimir Arsenyev]]'s autobiographical work ''[[Dersu Uzala]]''. The book, about a [[Nani people|Goldi]] hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the [[9th Moscow International Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow1975&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1975 |title=9th Moscow International Film Festival (1975) |accessdate=2013-01-04 |work=MIFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=127–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=518–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although proposals for television projects were submitted to him, he had no interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for [[Suntory]] whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=513–514, 522–523, 544–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two epics (1978–1986)===
In 1977, American director [[George Lucas]] had released ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', a wildly successful [[science fiction]] film influenced by Kurosawa's ''The Hidden Fortress'', among other works. Lucas, like many other [[New Hollywood]] directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked to discover that the Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: ''[[Kagemusha]]'', the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce ''Kagemusha'', then recruited fellow fan [[Francis Ford Coppola]] as co-producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production began the following April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor, [[Shintaro Katsu]]—creator of the very popular [[Zatoichi]] character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting ''Kagemusha'', collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=547–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=204–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ran storyboards.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A painting by Akira Kurosawa of the &quot;third castle&quot; scene in ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. Kurosawa used such paintings as [[storyboard]]s to assist his crew in the construction and filming of the scenes.|alt=A storyboard image painted by Kurosawa for the movie, ''Ran'': it depicts what appears to be a gate, behind which is a long flight of steps, around which are depicted various large structures in the style of 16th Century Japan.]]
The international success of ''Kagemusha'' allowed Kurosawa to proceed with his next project, ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'', another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty [[daimyo]] (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer [[Serge Silberman]], who had produced [[Luis Buñuel]]'s final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=569–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1985, production of ''Ran'' was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned to finish his film and ''Ran'' premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on May 31, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, as he had done with ''Kagemusha'', Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=576–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ran'' won several awards in Japan, but was not quite as honored there as many of the director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was shocked, however, when Japan passed over the film in favor of another as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]] category. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed this to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether ''Ran'' qualified as a ''Japanese'' film, a ''French'' film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director [[Sidney Lumet]] led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] that year ([[Sydney Pollack]] ultimately won the award for directing [[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]). ''Ran'''s costume designer, [[Emi Wada]], won the movie's only Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089881/awards |title=Ran (1985) – Awards |accessdate=2010-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100905114414/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089881/awards| archivedate= 5 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=582–586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kagemusha'' and ''Ran'', particularly the latter, are often considered to be among Kurosawa's finest works. After ''Ran'''s release, Kurosawa would point to it as his best film, a major change of attitude for the director who, when asked which of his works was his best, had always previously answered &quot;my next one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=580–586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie1999|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final works and last years (1987–1998)===
For his next movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures (for example, ''Drunken Angel'' and ''Kagemusha'') had included brief dream sequences, ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' was to be entirely based upon the director's own dreams. Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan, [[Steven Spielberg]], who convinced [[Warner Bros.]] to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawa's son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film's production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and ''Dreams'' premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spielberg&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=604–608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with ''[[Rhapsody in August]]''—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since ''Dodeskaden'' over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on May 25 that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=612–618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gere&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/01/movies/kurosawa-still-finding-unfamiliar-seas-to-sail.html |author=Weisman, Steven R.|title=Kurosawa Still Finding Unfamiliar Seas to Sail |accessdate=2010-08-29 | work=The New York Times | date=1990-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MADADAYO.JPG|thumb|upright|The Japanese theatrical poster, designed by Kurosawa himself, for the film that turned out to be his last: ''[[Madadayo]]'' (''Not Yet'') (1993)|alt=A poster for Kurosawa's last film, ''Madadayo'', hand-drawn by Kurosawa himself: the image shows the figure of an elderly man in a business suit, apparently dancing on a table, with a fan in each hand, surrounded by similarly attired men observing his dance; below this image are childish Japanese characters spelling out the title of the film.]]
Kurosawa wasted no time moving onto his next project: ''[[Madadayo]]'', or ''Not Yet''. Based on autobiographical essays by [[Hyakken Uchida]], the film follows the life of a Japanese professor of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=622–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa nevertheless continued to work. He wrote the original screenplays ''The Sea is Watching'' in 1993 and ''After the Rain'' in 1995. While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=636–639}}&lt;/ref&gt; His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie&lt;ref name=&quot;Gere&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;—was never to be fulfilled.

===Death and posthumous works===
Following his accident in 1995, Kurosawa's health began to deteriorate. While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a [[stroke]] in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=639–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kurosawa's death, several posthumous works based on his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. ''[[After the Rain (film)|After the Rain]]'', directed by [[Takashi Koizumi]], was released in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=641–645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181960 |title=After the Rain (1999) |accessdate=2010-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100901132853/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181960| archivedate= 1 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Sea is Watching'', directed by [[Kei Kumai]], premiered in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316829 |title=The Sea Is Watching (2002) |accessdate=2010-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728115832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316829| archivedate= 28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A script created by the Yonki no Kai (&quot;Club of the Four Knights&quot;) (Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa), around the time that ''Dodeskaden'' was made, finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as ''Dora-Heita'', by the only surviving founding member of the club, Kon Ichikawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20000523a1.html |title=The samurai flick that got away |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working methods, style and themes==

===Working methods===
All biographical sources, as well as the filmmaker's own comments, indicate that Kurosawa was a completely &quot;hands-on&quot; director, passionately involved in every aspect of the filmmaking process. As one interviewer summarized, &quot;he (co-)writes his scripts, oversees the design, rehearses the actors, sets up all the shots and then does the editing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|2008|loc=p. 131, reprinted from John Powers interview, [[L.A. Weekly]], 4 April 1986, pp. 45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; His active participation extended from the initial concept to the editing and scoring of the final product.

====Script====
Kurosawa emphasized time and again that the screenplay was the absolute foundation of a successful film and that, though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a ''good'' script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a ''bad'' script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the postwar period, he began the practice of collaborating with a rotating group of five screenwriters: Eijirō Hisaita, Ryuzo Kikushima, [[Shinobu Hashimoto]], Hideo Oguni, and Masato Ide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever members of this group happened to be working on a particular film would gather around a table, often at a hot-springs resort, where they would not be distracted by the outside world. (''Seven Samurai'', for example, was written in this fashion.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create''&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often they all (except Oguni, who acted as &quot;referee&quot;) would work on exactly the same pages of the script, and Kurosawa would choose the best-written version from the different drafts of each particular scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Shinobu Hashimoto interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was adopted &quot;so that each contributor might function as a kind of foil, checking the dominance of any one person's point-of-view.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the actual script, Kurosawa at this stage often produced extensive, fantastically detailed notes to elaborate his vision. For example, for ''Seven Samurai'', he created six notebooks in which he created (among many other things) detailed biographies of the samurai, including what they wore and ate, how they walked, talked and behaved when greeted, and even how each tied his shoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create''&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 101 peasant characters in the film, he created a registry consisting of 23 families and instructed the performers playing these roles to live and work as these &quot;families&quot; for the duration of shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shooting====
For his early films, although they were consistently well photographed, Kurosawa generally used standard lenses and deep-focus photography. Beginning with ''Seven Samurai'' (1954), however, Kurosawa's cinematic technique changed drastically with his extensive use of [[Long focus lens|long lens]] and multiple cameras. The director claimed that he used these lenses and several cameras rolling at once to help the actors—allowing them to be photographed at some distance from the lens, and without any knowledge of which particular camera's image would be utilized in the final cut—making their performances much more natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, Tatsuya Nakadai agreed that the multiple cameras greatly helped his performances with the director.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Tatsuya Nakadai interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; But these changes had a powerful effect as well on the look of the action scenes in that film, particularly the final battle in the rain. Says Stephen Prince: &quot;He can use the telephoto lenses to get under the horses, in between their hooves, to plunge us into the chaos of that battle in a visual way that is really quite unprecedented, both in Kurosawa's own work and in the samurai genre as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Stephen Prince commentary&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD bonus featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Stephen Prince commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''The Hidden Fortress'', Kurosawa began to utilize the [[widescreen]] ([[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]]) process for the first time in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three techniques—long lenses, multiple cameras and widescreen—were in later works fully exploited, even in sequences with little or no overt action, such as the early scenes of ''High and Low'' that take place in the central character's home, in which they are employed to dramatize tensions and power relationships between the characters within a highly confined space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=190–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his films, but particularly for his ''[[jidaigeki]]'', Kurosawa insisted on absolute authenticity of sets, costumes and props. Numerous instances of his fanatical devotion to detail have been recorded, of which the following are only a few examples.

For ''Throne of Blood'', in the scene where Washizu (Mifune) is attacked with arrows by his own men, the director had archers shoot real arrows, hollowed out and running along wires, toward Toshiro Mifune from a distance of about ten feet, with the actor carefully following chalk marks on the ground to avoid being hit. (Some of the arrows missed him by an inch; the actor, who admitted that he was not merely ''acting'' terrified in the film, suffered nightmares afterward).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Red Beard'', to construct the gate for the clinic set, Kurosawa had his assistants dismantle rotten wood from old sets and then create the prop from scratch with this old wood, so the gate would look properly ravaged by time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Yoshirō Muraki interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same film, for teacups that appeared in the movie, he ordered his crew to pour fifty years' worth of tea into the cups so they would appear appropriately stained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Ran'', art director [[Yoshirō Muraki]], constructing the &quot;third castle&quot; set under the director's supervision, created the &quot;stones&quot; of that castle by having photographs taken of actual stones from a celebrated castle, then painting [[Styrofoam]] blocks to exactly resemble those stones and gluing them to the castle &quot;wall&quot; through a process known as &quot;rough-stone piling&quot;, which required months of work. Later, before shooting the famous scene in which the castle is attacked and set on fire, in order to prevent the Styrofoam &quot;stones&quot; from melting in the heat, the art department coated the surface with four layers of cement, then painted the colors of the ancient stones onto the cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Editing====
Kurosawa both directed and edited most of his films, which is nearly unique among prominent filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of film director and editor collaborations]]. The [[Coen Brothers]] are perhaps the best known contemporary filmmakers who both direct and edit their films.&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa often remarked that he shot a film simply in order to have material to edit, because the editing of a picture was the most important and creatively interesting part of the process for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=229, 238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa's creative team believed that the director's skill with editing was his greatest talent. Hiroshi Nezu, a longtime production supervisor on his films, said, &quot;Among ourselves, we think that he is Toho's best director, that he is Japan's best scenarist, and that he is the best editor in the world. He is most concerned with the flowing quality which a film must have&amp;nbsp;... The Kurosawa film flows ''over'' the cut, as it were.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director's frequent crew member Teruyo Nogami confirms this view. &quot;Akira Kurosawa's editing was exceptional, the inimitable work of a genius&amp;nbsp;... No one was a match for him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that Kurosawa carried in his head all the information about all shots filmed, and if, in the editing room, he asked for a piece of film and she handed him the wrong one, he would immediately recognize the error, though she had taken detailed notes on each shot and he had not. She compared his mind to a computer, which could do with edited segments of film what computers do today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Teruyo Nogami interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's habitual method was to edit a film daily, bit by bit, during production. This helped particularly when he started using multiple cameras, which resulted in a large amount of film to assemble. &quot;I always edit in the evening if we have a fair amount of footage in the can. After watching the rushes, I usually go to the editing room and work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|2008|loc=p. 53, reprinted from Yoshi Shirai interview, Cinema, Spring 1972, pp. 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this practice of editing as he went along, the post-production period for a Kurosawa film could be startlingly brief: ''Yojimbo'' had its Japanese premiere on April 20, 1961, ''four days'' after shooting concluded on April 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The &quot;Kurosawa-gumi&quot;====
Throughout his career, Kurosawa worked constantly with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians, crew members and actors, popularly known as the &quot;Kurosawa-gumi&quot; (Kurosawa group). The following is a partial list of this group, divided by profession. This information is derived from the [[IMDB]] pages for Kurosawa's films&lt;ref name=&quot;Akira Kurosawa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041|title=Akira Kurosawa |accessdate=2010-07-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100724065118/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041| archivedate= 24 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stuart Galbraith's IV's filmography:&lt;ref name=&quot;filmog&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=651–751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Composers''': [[Fumio Hayasaka]] (''Drunken Angel'', ''Stray Dog'', ''Scandal'', ''Rashomon'', ''The Idiot'', ''Ikiru'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''Record of a Living Being''); [[Masaru Sato]] (''Throne of Blood'', ''The Lower Depths'', ''The Hidden Fortress'', ''The Bad Sleep Well'', ''Yojimbo'', ''Sanjuro'', ''High and Low'', ''Red Beard''); [[Tōru Takemitsu]] (''Dodeskaden'', ''Ran''); [[Shin-ichirō Ikebe]] (''Kagemusha'', ''Dreams'', ''Rhapsody in August'', ''Madadayo'').

'''Cinematographers''': [[Asakazu Nakai]] (''No Regrets for Our Youth'', ''One Wonderful Sunday'', ''Stray Dog'', ''Ikiru'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''Record of a Living Being'', ''Throne of Blood'', ''High and Low'', ''Red Beard'', ''Dersu Uzala'', ''Ran''); [[Kazuo Miyagawa]] (''Rashomon'', ''Yojimbo'');&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Miyagawa was hired as cinematographer for ''Kagemusha'', but about one month into shooting, eye problems caused by diabetes forced him to drop out of the project. See Galbraith, pp. 548–549.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takao Saito (cinematographer)|Takao Saitō]] (''Sanjuro'', ''High and Low'', ''Red Beard'', ''Dodeskaden'', ''Kagemusha'', ''Ran'', ''Dreams'', ''Rhapsody in August'', ''Madadayo'').

'''Art Department''': [[Yoshirō Muraki]] served as either assistant art director, art director or production designer for all Kurosawa's films (except for ''Dersu Uzala'') from ''Drunken Angel'' until the end of the director's career.

'''Production Crew''': Teruyo Nogami served as script supervisor, production manager, associate director or assistant to the producer on all Kurosawa's films from ''Rashomon'' to the end of the director's career. Hiroshi Nezu was production supervisor or unit production manager on all the films from ''Seven Samurai'' to ''Dodeskaden'', except ''Sanjuro''. After retiring as a director, [[Ishirō Honda]] returned more than 30 years later to work again for his friend and former mentor as a directorial advisor, production coordinator and creative consultant on Kurosawa's last five films (''Kagemusha'', ''Ran'', ''Dreams'', ''Rhapsody in August'' and ''Madadayo''). Allegedly one segment of ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' was actually directed by Honda following Kurosawa's detailed storyboards.

'''Actors''': ''Leading actors'': [[Takashi Shimura]] (21 films); [[Toshiro Mifune]] (16 films), [[Susumu Fujita]] (8 films), [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] (6 films) and [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] (5 films).
''Supporting performers'' (in alphabetical order): [[Minoru Chiaki]], [[Kamatari Fujiwara]], [[Bokuzen Hidari]], Fumiko Homma, Hisashi Igawa, Yunosuke Ito, [[Kyoko Kagawa]], [[Daisuke Kato]], [[Isao Kimura]], Kokuten Kodo, Akitake Kono, Yoshio Kosugi, Koji Mitsui, [[Seiji Miyaguchi]], Eiko Miyoshi, [[Nobuo Nakamura]], [[Akemi Negishi]], [[Denjiro Okochi]], [[Noriko Sengoku]], Gen Shimizu, Ichiro Sugai, Haruo Tanaka, [[Akira Terao]], [[Eijiro Tono]], [[Yoshio Tsuchiya]], Kichijiro Ueda, Atsushi Watanabe, [[Isuzu Yamada]], [[Tsutomu Yamazaki]] and Yoshitaka Zushi.

===Style===
Virtually all commentators have noted Kurosawa's bold, dynamic style, which many have compared to the traditional Hollywood style of narrative moviemaking, one that emphasizes, in the words of one such scholar, &quot;chronological, causal, linear and historical thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desser|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it has also been claimed that, from his very first film, the director displayed a technique quite distinct from the seamless style of classic Hollywood. This technique involved a disruptive depiction of screen space through the use of numerous unrepeated camera setups, a disregard for the traditional 180-degree axis of action around which Hollywood scenes have usually been constructed, and an approach in which &quot;narrative time becomes spatialized&quot;, with fluid camera movement often replacing conventional editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are some idiosyncratic aspects of the artist's style.

====The axial cut====
In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the [[Axial cut|&quot;axial cut,&quot;]] in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of [[tracking shot]]s or [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], but through a series of matched [[jump cut]]s. For example, in ''Sanshiro Sugata II'', the hero takes leave of the woman he loves, but then, after walking away a short distance, turns and bows to her, and then, after walking further, turns and bows once more. This sequence of shots is illustrated on film scholar [[David Bordwell]]'s blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=6308 |title=Observations on Film Art: Kurosawa's Early Spring |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three shots are not connected in the film by camera movements or dissolves, but by a series of two jump cuts. The effect is to stress the duration of Sanshiro's departure.

In the opening sequence of ''Seven Samurai'' in the peasant village, the axial cut is used twice. When the villagers are outdoors, gathered in a circle, weeping and lamenting the imminent arrival of the bandits, they are glimpsed from above in extreme long shot, then, after the cut, in a much closer shot, then in an even closer shot at ground level as the dialogue begins. A few minutes later, when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elder's advice, there is a long shot of the mill, with a slowly turning wheel in the river, then a closer shot of this wheel, and then a still closer shot of it. (As the mill is where the elder lives, these shots forge a mental association in the viewer's mind between that character and the mill.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=Stephen Prince commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cutting on motion====
A number of scholars have pointed out Kurosawa's tendency to &quot;cut on motion&quot;: that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot. One scholar, as an example, describes a tense scene in ''Seven Samurai'' in which the samurai Shichirôji, who is standing, wishes to console the peasant Manzo, who is sitting on the ground, and he gets down on one knee to talk to him. Kurosawa chooses to film this simple action in two shots rather than one (cutting between the two only ''after'' the action of kneeling has begun) to fully convey Shichirôji's humility. Numerous other instances of this device are evident in the movie. &quot;Kurosawa [frequently] breaks up the action, fragments it, in order to create an emotional effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellentalk&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD bonus featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Joan Mellen commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The wipe====
A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]]. This is an effect created through an [[optical printer]], in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to move across the screen, &quot;wiping&quot; away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] (though Kurosawa, of course, often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in ''Drunken Angel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewissaul.blogspot.com/2008/02/85-akira-kurosawa-yoidore-tenshi.html |title=Akira Kurosawa YOIDORE TENSHI |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of theories concerning the purpose of this device, which, as James Goodwin notes, was common in silent cinema but became considerably rarer in the more &quot;realistic&quot; sound cinema.&lt;ref name=&quot;wipe&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin1993|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin claims that the wipes in ''Rashomon'', for instance, fulfill one of three purposes: emphasizing motion in traveling shots, marking narrative shifts in the courtyard scenes and marking temporal ellipses between actions (e.g., between the end of one character's testimony and the beginning of another's).&lt;ref name=&quot;wipe&quot;/&gt; He also points out that in ''The Lower Depths'', in which Kurosawa completely avoided the use of wipes, the director cleverly manipulated people and props &quot;in order to slide new visual images in and out of view much as a wipe cut does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin1993|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An instance of the wipe used as a satirical device can be seen in ''Ikiru''. A group of women visit the local government office to petition the bureaucrats to turn a waste area into a children's playground. The viewer is then shown a series of [[Point of view shot|point of view]] shots of various bureaucrats, connected by wipe transitions, each of whom refers the group to another department.  Nora Tennessen comments in her blog (which shows one example) that &quot;the wipe technique makes [the sequence] funnier—images of bureaucrats are stacked like cards, each more punctilious than the last.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trixmcgovern.blogspot.com/2010/01/wipe-out-kurosawas-tricky-cuts.html |title=Trix McGovern, Girl Reporter: WIPE-OUT: Kurosawa's Tricky Cuts |author=Tennessen, Nora |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Image-sound counterpoint====
Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films (Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives many such examples).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=183–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, he began to employ music for what he called &quot;counterpoint&quot; to the emotional content of a scene, rather than merely to reinforce the emotion, as Hollywood traditionally did (and still does). The inspiration for this innovation came from a family tragedy. When news reached Kurosawa of his father's death in 1948, he wandered aimlessly through the streets of Tokyo. His sorrow was magnified rather than diminished when he suddenly heard the cheerful, vapid song &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot;, and he hurried to escape from this &quot;awful music.&quot; He then told his composer, [[Fumio Hayasaka]], with whom he was working on ''Drunken Angel'', to use &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot; as ironic accompaniment to the scene in which the dying gangster, Matsunaga, sinks to his lowest point in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ironic approach to music can also be found in ''Stray Dog'', a film released a year after ''Drunken Angel''. In the climactic scene, the detective Murakami is fighting furiously with the murderer Yusa in a muddy field. The sound of a Mozart piece is suddenly heard, played on the piano by a woman in a nearby house. As one commentator notes, &quot;In contrast to this scene of primitive violence, the serenity of the Mozart is, literally, other-worldly&quot; and &quot;the power of this elemental encounter is heightened by the music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was Kurosawa's &quot;ironic&quot; use of the soundtrack limited to music. One critic observes that, in ''Seven Samurai'', &quot;During episodes of murder and mayhem, birds chirp in the background, as they do in the first scene when the farmers lament their seemingly hopeless fate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring themes===

====The master–disciple relationship====
Many commentators have noted the frequent occurrence in Kurosawa's work of the complex relationship between an older and a younger man, who serve each other as master and disciple, respectively. This theme was clearly an expression of the director's life experience. &quot;Kurosawa revered his teachers, in particular Kajiro Yamamoto, his mentor at Toho&quot;, according to Joan Mellen. &quot;The salutary image of an older person instructing the young evokes always in Kurosawa's films high moments of pathos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic Tadao Sato considers the recurring character of the &quot;master&quot; to be a type of surrogate father, whose role it is to witness the young protagonist's moral growth and approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sato|pp=126–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his very first film, ''Sanshiro Sugata'', after the [[Judo]] master Yano becomes the title character's teacher and spiritual guide, &quot;the narrative [is] cast in the form of a chronicle studying the stages of the hero's growing mastery and maturity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The master-pupil relationship in the films of the postwar era—as depicted in such works as ''Drunken Angel'', ''Stray Dog'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''Red Beard'' and ''Dersu Uzala''—involves very little direct instruction, but much learning through experience and example; Stephen Prince relates this tendency to the private and nonverbal nature of the concept of [[Zen]] enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of ''Kagemusha'', however, according to Prince, the meaning of this relationship has changed. A thief chosen to act as the double of a great lord continues his impersonation even after his master's death: &quot;the relationship has become spectral and is generated from beyond the grave with the master maintaining a ghostly presence. Its end is death, not the renewal of commitment to the living that typified its outcome in earlier films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the director's biographer, in his final film, ''Madadayo''—which deals with a teacher and his relationship with an entire group of ex-pupils—a sunnier vision of the theme emerges. &quot;The students hold an annual party for their professor, attended by dozens of former students, now adults of varying age&amp;nbsp;... This extended sequence&amp;nbsp;... expresses, as only Kurosawa can, the simple joys of student-teacher relationships, of kinship, of being alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The heroic champion====
Kurosawa's is a ''heroic'' cinema, a series of dramas (mostly) concerned with the deeds and fates of larger-than-life heroes. Stephen Prince has identified the emergence of the unique Kurosawa protagonist with the immediate post-World War II period. The goal of the [[Occupation of Japan|American Occupation]] to replace Japanese [[feudalism]] with [[individualism]] coincided with the director's artistic and social agenda: &quot;Kurosawa welcomed the changed political climate and sought to fashion his own mature cinematic voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese critic Tadao Sato concurs: &quot;With defeat in World War II, many Japanese&amp;nbsp;... were dumbfounded to find that the government had lied to them and was neither just nor dependable. During this uncertain time Akira Kurosawa, in a series of first-rate films, sustained the people by his consistent assertion that the meaning of life is not dictated by the nation but something each individual should discover for himself through suffering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sato|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmaker himself remarked that, during this period, &quot;I felt that without the establishment of the self as a positive value there could be no freedom and no democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such postwar hero was, atypically for the artist, a heroine—Yukie, played by Setsuko Hara, in ''No Regrets for Our Youth''. According to Prince, her &quot;desertion of family and class background to assist a poor village, her perseverance in the face of enormous obstacles, her assumption of responsibility for her own life and for the well-being of others, and her [[Existentialism|existential]] loneliness&amp;nbsp;... are essential to Kurosawan heroism and make of Yukie the first coherent&amp;nbsp;... example.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;existential loneliness&quot; is also exemplified by Dr. Sanada (Takashi Shimura) in ''Drunken Angel'': &quot;Kurosawa insists that his heroes take their stand, alone, against tradition and battle for a better world, even if the path there is not clear. Separation from a corrupt social system in order to alleviate human suffering, as Sanada does, is the only honorable course.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators regard ''Seven Samurai'' as the ultimate expression of the artist's heroic ideal. Joan Mellen's comments are typical of this view: &quot;Seven Samurai is above all a homage to the samurai class at its most noble&amp;nbsp;... Samurai for Kurosawa represent the best of Japanese tradition and integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it is because of, not in spite of, the chaotic times of civil war depicted in the film that the seven rise to greatness. &quot;Kurosawa locates the unexpected benefits no less than the tragedy of this historical moment. The upheaval forces samurai to channel the selflessness of their credo of loyal service into working for peasants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this heroism is futile because &quot;there was already rising&amp;nbsp;... a merchant class which would supplant the warrior aristocracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the courage and supreme skill of the central characters will not prevent the ultimate destruction of themselves or their class.

As Kurosawa's career progressed he seemed to find it increasingly difficult to sustain the heroic ideal. As Prince notes, &quot;Kurosawa's is an essentially tragic vision of life, and this sensibility&amp;nbsp;... impedes his efforts to realize a socially committed mode of filmmaking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the director's ideal of heroism is subverted by history itself: &quot;When history is articulated as it is in ''Throne of Blood'', as a blind force&amp;nbsp;... heroism ceases to be a problem or a reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prince, the filmmaker's vision eventually became so bleak that he would come to view history merely as eternally recurring patterns of violence, within which the individual is depicted as not only unheroic, but utterly helpless (see &quot;[[#Cycles of violence|Cycles of violence]]&quot; below).

====Nature and weather====
Nature is a crucial element in Kurosawa's films. According to Stephen Prince, &quot;Kurosawa's sensibility, like that of many Japanese artists, is keenly sensitive to the subtleties and beauties of season and scenery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has never hesitated to exploit climate and weather as plot elements, to the point where they become &quot;active participants in the drama&amp;nbsp;... The oppressive heat in ''Stray Dog'' and ''Record of a Living Being'' is omnipresent and becomes thematized as a signifier of a world disjointed by economic collapse and the atomic threat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director himself once said, &quot;I like hot summers, cold winters, heavy rains and snows, and I think most of my pictures show this. I like extremes because I find them most alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind is also a powerful symbol: &quot;The persistent metaphor of Kurosawa's work is that of wind, the winds of change, of fortune and adversity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The visually flamboyant [final] battle [of ''Yojimbo''] takes place in the main street, as huge clouds of dust swirl around the combatants&amp;nbsp;... The winds that stir the dust&amp;nbsp;... have brought firearms to the town along with the culture of the West, which will end the warrior tradition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also difficult not to notice the importance of rain to Kurosawa: &quot;Rain in Kurosawa's films is never treated neutrally. When it occurs&amp;nbsp;... it is never a drizzle or a light mist but always a frenzied downpour, a driving storm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The final battle [in ''Seven Samurai''] is a supreme spiritual and physical struggle, and it is fought in a blinding rainstorm, which enables Kurosawa to visualize an ultimate fusion of social groups&amp;nbsp;... but this climactic vision of classlessness, with typical Kurosawan ambivalence, has become a vision of horror. The battle is a vortex of swirling rain and mud&amp;nbsp;... The ultimate fusion of social identity emerges as an expression of hellish chaos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cycles of violence====
Beginning with ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), an obsession with historical cycles of inexorable savage violence—what Stephen Prince calls &quot;the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;—first appears. According to Donald Richie, within the world of that film, &quot;Cause and effect is the only law. Freedom does not exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Prince claims that its events &quot;are inscribed in a cycle of time that infinitely repeats.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He uses as evidence the fact that Washizu's lord, unlike the kindly King Duncan of Shakespeare's play, had murdered his own lord years before to seize power, and is then murdered in turn by Washizu (the Macbeth character) for the same reason.)&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;/&gt; &quot;The fated quality to the action of [[Macbeth]]&amp;nbsp;... was transposed by Kurosawa with a sharpened emphasis upon predetermined action and the crushing of human freedom beneath the laws of [[karma]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;/&gt;

Prince claims that Kurosawa's last epics, ''Kagemusha'' and particularly ''Ran'', mark a major turning point in the director's vision of the world. In ''Kagemusha'', &quot;where once [in the world of his films] the individual [hero] could grasp events tightly and demand that they conform to his or her impulses, now the self is but the epiphenomenon of a ruthless and bloody temporal process, ground to dust beneath the weight and force of history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following epic, ''Ran'', is &quot;a relentless chronicle of base lust for power, betrayal of the father by his sons, and pervasive wars and murders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ran&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical setting of the film is used as &quot;a commentary on what Kurosawa now perceives as the timelessness of human impulses toward violence and self-destruction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ran&quot;/&gt; &quot;History has given way to a perception of life as a wheel of endless suffering, ever turning, ever repeating&quot;, which is compared in many instances in the screenplay with hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Kurosawa has found hell to be both the inevitable outcome of human behavior and the appropriate visualization of his own bitterness and disappointment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{main|Akira Kurosawa: Summary of criticisms}}
Despite the extraordinary acclaim that Kurosawa's work has received in Japan and abroad, his films, as well as Kurosawa as an individual, have also been subject to considerable criticism, much of it harsh. Below are summarized some of the more common criticisms of the director, both those made generally and those that are primarily voiced in Japan.

===In general===
In the early to mid-1950s, a number of critics belonging to the French New Wave championed the films of the older Japanese master, [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], at the expense of Kurosawa's work. New Wave critic-filmmaker [[Jacques Rivette]], said: &quot;You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough&amp;nbsp;... [Mizoguchi] seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/beauty_beneath_the_brutality_japanese_masters_mizoguchi_and_ozu_3225 |title=Beauty Beneath the Brutality: Japanese Masters Mizoguchi and Ozu |publisher=moviemaker.com |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between &quot;Japanese&quot; Mizoguchi and &quot;Western&quot; Kurosawa by pointing out that &quot;Mizo&quot; had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa, and that this is reflected in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism frequently directed at Kurosawa's films is that the director's preoccupation with ethical and moral themes led him at times to create what some commentators regard as [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] or naïve work. Speaking of the postwar &quot;[[slice of life]]&quot; drama ''One Wonderful Sunday'', for example, film scholar (and future politician) [[Audie Bock]] claimed that not even Kurosawa's celebrated prowess as an editor could save one particular scene from bathos: &quot;The last sequence&amp;nbsp;... is an excruciating twelve minutes of the boy conducting an imaginary orchestra in an empty amphitheater while his girlfriend appeals directly to the camera for the viewer to join in. Angles and focal lengths change, details of leaves scattering in the wind are intercut, but nothing makes the scene go any faster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy exists about the extent to which Kurosawa's films of the Second World War period could be considered fascist [[propaganda]]. The cultural historian Peter B. High sees Kurosawa's wartime cinema as part of the propagandistic trend of Japan at war and as an example of many of these wartime conventions. High refers to his second film, ''The Most Beautiful'', as a &quot;dark and gloomy rendition of the standard formulas of the [home front] genre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|High|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversy centers on his alleged refusal to acknowledge Japan's wartime guilt. In one of Kurosawa's last films, ''Rhapsody in August'', an elderly survivor of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic attack on Nagasaki]] is visited by her half-Japanese, half-American nephew, Clark ([[Richard Gere]]), who appears (at least to some viewers) to apologize, as an American, for the city's wartime destruction. The ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] wrote about this film: &quot;A lot of people at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] were outraged that the film makes no mention of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and Japan's atrocities in China&amp;nbsp;... If Clark can apologize for bombing [[Nagasaki]], why can't Granny apologize for the raid on Pearl Harbor?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/20/movies/review-film-kurosawa-small-in-scale-and-blunt.html |title=Review/Film; Kurosawa, Small in Scale and Blunt |author=Canby, Vincent |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1991-12-20 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of critics have reacted negatively to the female characters in Kurosawa's movies. Joan Mellen, in her examination of this subject, has maintained that, by the time of ''Red Beard'' (1965), &quot;women in Kurosawa have become not only unreal and incapable of kindness, but totally bereft of autonomy, whether physical, intellectual, or emotional&amp;nbsp;... Women at their best may only imitate the truths men discover.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince concurs with Mellen's view, though less censoriously: &quot;Unlike a male-oriented director like [[Sam Peckinpah]], Kurosawa is not hostile to women, but his general lack of interest in them should be regarded as a major limitation of his work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Japan===
In Japan, both critics and other filmmakers have sometimes accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In her commentary on the deluxe DVD edition of ''Seven Samurai'', Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa &quot;privileging&quot; these samurai, &quot;support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist&amp;nbsp;... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village. Instead, justifying the inequitable class structure of their society and ours, the peasants must rely on the aristocracy, the upper class, and in particular samurai, to ensure their survival&amp;nbsp;... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth&amp;nbsp;... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellentalk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Kurosawa's popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] director [[Nagisa Oshima]] to Kurosawa and his work, states: &quot;That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [to Oshima] that he must be [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] to Western values and politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: &quot;He has never catered to a foreign audience&quot; writes Audie Bock, &quot;and has condemned those who do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived &quot;arrogant&quot; behavior. It was in Japan that the (initially) disparaging nickname &quot;Kurosawa Tennō&quot;—&quot;The Emperor Kurosawa&quot;—was coined. &quot;Like [[Emperor of Japan|tennō]]&quot;, Yoshimoto claimed, &quot;Kurosawa is said to cloister himself in his own small world, which is completely cut off from the everyday reality of the majority of Japanese. The nickname tennō is used in this sense to create an image of Kurosawa as a director who abuses his power solely for the purpose of self-indulgence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide impact==

===Reputation among filmmakers===
Many celebrated directors have been influenced by Kurosawa and/or have expressed admiration for his work. The filmmakers cited below are grouped according to three categories: a) those who, like Kurosawa himself, established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s; b) the so-called &quot;[[New Hollywood]]&quot; directors, that is, American moviemakers who, for the most part, established their reputations in the early to mid-1970s; and c) other Asian directors.

[[File:Robert Altman Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Robert Altman]] was so impressed that Kurosawa had his cinematographer on ''Rashomon'' shoot directly into the sun that he immediately began to incorporate such shots in his own television work.|alt=Photo of the director Robert Altman in his mid-60s, wearing a goatee, glasses, a wide-brimmed white hat and a jacket and looking directly into the camera.]]
[[Ingmar Bergman]] called his own film ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' &quot;touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa&quot;, and added, &quot;At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ingmar Bergman Foundation |url=http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=2E2291EF-1288-4A78-9510-B00F0F1D4CDB |title=Ingmar Bergman on Akira Kurosawa |publisher=Ingmarbergman.se |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Fellini]] in an interview declared the director &quot;the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be&quot;—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, ''Seven Samurai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fellini|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Polanski]] in 1965 cited Kurosawa as one of his three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and [[Orson Welles]]), singling out ''Seven Samurai'', ''Throne of Blood'' and ''The Hidden Fortress'' for praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: &quot;Kurosawa's movies and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=Bernardo Bertolucci interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's &quot;New Hollywood&quot; admirers have included [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Steven Spielberg]],&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ncVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5882%2C1850102 |title=Filmmaker remembered as 'pictorial Shakespeare' |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard (via Google News Archive) |agency=The Associated Press |date=1998-09-07 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Scorsese]],&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;/&gt; [[George Lucas]],&lt;ref name=anaheim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheim.edu/content/view/758/720/ |title=Akira Kurosowa Memorial Tribute |publisher=Anaheim.edu |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plume, Ken |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/401/401150p7.html |title=An Interview with John Milius – Movies Feature at IGN |publisher=Movies.ign.com |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Altman, when he first saw ''Rashomon'' (during the period when he worked regularly in television rather than feature films), was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashomon|loc=Robert Altman Introductory Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, &quot;One thing that distinguishes [him] is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, ''eight'' masterpieces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=Francis Ford Coppola interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model—as a ''[[sensei]]'', to use the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared, &quot;I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker on the face of the earth&quot;,&lt;ref name=anaheim/&gt; while Scorsese remarked, &quot;Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master, and&amp;nbsp;... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years.&quot;&lt;ref name=anaheim/&gt; As already noted above, several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on ''Kagemusha'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot; /&gt; while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, ''Dreams'', helped bring that picture to fruition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spielberg&quot; /&gt;

As the first Asian filmmaker to achieve international prominence, Kurosawa has naturally served as an inspiration for other Asian ''[[Auteur theory|auteurs]]''. Of ''Rashomon'', the most famous director of India, [[Satyajit Ray]], said: &quot;The effect of the film on me [upon first seeing it in Calcutta in 1952] was electric. I saw it three times on consecutive days, and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director's command over every aspect of film making.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ray|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director [[Takeshi Kitano]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tirard|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong filmmaker [[John Woo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=John Woo interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/callingtheshots/john_woo.shtml |title=Movies – Calling the Shots No.10: John Woo |author=Pierce, Nev |publisher=BBC |date=2004-01-16 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/15/movies/20080714201452&amp;sec=movies |title=Epic homecoming |author=Koay, Allan |publisher=Star-ecentral.com |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mainland China|mainland Chinese]] director [[Zhang Yimou]], who called Kurosawa &quot;the quintessential Asian director.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/kurosawa1.html |title=Time 100: Akira Kurosawa |publisher=Time.com |date=1999-08-23 |accessdate=2009-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090618180225/http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/kurosawa1.html| archivedate= 18 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Kurosawa Production Co., established in 1959, continues to oversee much of Kurosawa's legacy. The director's son, Hisao Kurosawa, is the current head of the company. Its American subsidiary, Kurosawa Enterprises, is located in Los Angeles. Rights to Kurosawa's works are held by Kurosawa Production and the film studios under which he worked, most notably [[Toho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toho.co.jp |title=Web Site |publisher=Toho Co, Ltd. |language={{ja icon}} |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa Production works closely with the Akira Kurosawa Foundation, established in December 2003 and also run by Hisao Kurosawa. The foundation organizes an annual [[Akira Kurosawa Memorial Short Film Competition|short film competition]] and spearheads Kurosawa-related projects, including a recently shelved one to build a memorial museum for the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Money paid for building Akira Kurosawa museum to be returned |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/arts/news/20100606p2g00m0dm035000c.html |newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi Daily News]] |date=2010–06–06 |accessdate=2010–06–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the [[Kurosawa Film Studio]] was opened in Yokohama; two additional locations have since been launched in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurosawafilmstudio.com/info.html |title=Kurosawa Film Studio |publisher=Kurosawa Film Studio Co.

It offers online programs in digital film making, with headquarters in Anaheim and a learning center in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheim.edu/content/view/748/718 |title=Anaheim University - Online MBA, Online Green MBA and Online TESOL programs – Online MFA in Digital Filmmaking |publisher=Anaheim University |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two film awards have also been named in Kurosawa's honor. The Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Film Directing is awarded during the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], while the Akira Kurosawa Award is given during the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sffs.org/awards_tributes/search.php?search_by=1&amp;searchfield=Akira+Kurosawa+Award&amp;x=16&amp;y=10 |title=FILMS: San Francisco Film Festival |publisher=San Francisco Film Society |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994692.html?categoryId=3268&amp;cs=1 |author=Schilling, Mark |title=Mikhalkov given Kurosawa Award – Entertainment News, Tokyo Intl.

The AK100 Project aims to &quot;expose young people who are the representatives of the next generation, and all people everywhere, to the light and spirit of Akira Kurosawa and the wonderful world he created.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ak100wt.com/en |title=AK100 World Tour |publisher=AK100 World Tour team |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Egypt}} 
{{Small Egyptian Dynasty List}}
'''Ancient Egypt''' was an [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[civilization]] of [[Northeast Africa|Northeastern Africa]], concentrated along the lower reaches of the [[Nile|Nile River]] in what is now the modern country of [[Egypt]]. Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150&amp;nbsp;BC (according to [[conventional Egyptian chronology]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/index.html|title=Chronology|accessdate=25 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080316015559/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/index.html| archivedate= 16 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the political unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] under the first [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (2004) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[history of ancient Egypt]] occurred in a series of stable ''Kingdoms'', separated by periods of relative instability known as ''Intermediate Periods'': the [[Old Kingdom]] of the [[Early Bronze Age]], the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] and the [[New Kingdom]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]].

Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period where it rivalled the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Assyrian Empire]] and [[Mitanni]] [[Empire]], after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers (such as the [[Canaanites]]/[[Hyksos]], [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], [[Nubians]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]], [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Persian rule]] and [[Macedon]]ian [[Greece]]) in the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]] and [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]. In the aftermath of [[Alexander the Great]]'s death, one of his generals, [[Ptolemy Soter]], established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This [[Greece|Greek]] [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]] ruled Egypt until 30&amp;nbsp;BC, when, under [[Cleopatra]], it fell to the [[Roman Empire]] and became [[Egypt (Roman province)|a Roman province]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River Valley. The predictable flooding and controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which fueled [[social development]] and culture. With resources to spare, the [[administration (government)|administration]] sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|writing system]], the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to [[Military of ancient Egypt|defeat foreign enemies]] and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite [[Egyptian writing|scribe]]s, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a Pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that facilitated the building of monumental [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], [[Egyptian temple|temples]], and [[obelisk]]s; a system of [[Egyptian mathematics|mathematics]], a practical and effective [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|system of medicine]], irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt; [[Egyptian faience]] and glass technology, new forms of [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], and the [[Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty|earliest known peace treaty]] with [[Hittites]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period led to the [[Egyptology|scientific investigation]] of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of ancient Egypt|History of Egypt|Population history of Egypt}}

The [[Nile]] has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 17, 67–69&lt;/ref&gt; The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomadic [[Anatomically modern humans|modern human]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s began living in the Nile valley through the end of the [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] some 120&amp;nbsp;thousand years ago. By the late [[Paleolithic]] period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the region.

===Predynastic period===
{{Main|Predynastic Egypt}}
[[File:Egypte louvre 316.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A typical Naqada II jar decorated with gazelles. (Predynastic Period)]]
In Predynastic and [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic]] times, the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed [[savanna]] and traversed by herds of grazing [[ungulates]]. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first [[Domestication|domesticated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

By about [[6th millennium BC|5500 BC]], small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt, the [[Badari]] which probably originated in the Western Desert, was known for its high quality ceramics, [[stone tool]]s, and its use of copper.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1964) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

The Badari was followed by the [[Amratian culture|Amratian]] (Naqada I) and [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzeh]] (Naqada II) cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. Gordon (1953), &quot;New light on the most ancient Near East&quot; (Praeger Publications)&lt;/ref&gt; which brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported [[obsidian]] from [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], used to shape blades and other objects from [[Lithic flake|flakes]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara G.

The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality [[hand drill (hieroglyph)|decorative stone vase]]s, [[cosmetic palette]]s, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory.

===Early Dynastic Period (c. 3050&amp;nbsp;–2686 BC)===
{{Main|Early Dynastic Period of Egypt}} The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early [[Sumer]]ian-[[Akkadian]] civilisation of [[Mesopotamia]] and of ancient [[Elam]]. The third-century BC Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] grouped the long line of pharaohs from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to begin his official history with the king named &quot;Meni&quot; (or [[Menes]] in Greek) who was then believed to have united the two kingdoms of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]] (around 3100 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition to a unified state actually happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have actually been the pharaoh [[Narmer]], who is depicted wearing [[Regalia|royal regalia]] on the ceremonial Narmer Palette in a symbolic act of unification.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150&amp;nbsp;BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified their control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], from which they could control the [[labour force]] and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical [[trade route]]s to the [[Levant]]. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate [[mastaba]] tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080304143847/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html| archivedate= 4 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC)===
{{Main|Old Kingdom}}
[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|The Giza Pyramids]]Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the [[Old Kingdom]], fueled by the increased [[agricultural productivity]] made possible by a well-developed central administration.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve [[crop yield]], drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a [[Criminal law|justice system]] to maintain peace and order.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Khafre statue.jpg|thumb|right|Khafre Enthroned]]

Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. It is believed that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 116–7&lt;/ref&gt; As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with [[4.2 kiloyear event|severe droughts]] between 2200 and 2150&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/apocalypse_egypt_04.shtml |title=The Fall of the Old Kingdom |author=Fekri Hassan|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Intermediate Period (2181–1991 BC)===
{{Main|First Intermediate Period of Egypt}}
After Egypt's [[central government]] collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—a fact demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the [[optimism]] and originality of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw146&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Free from their loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and [[political power]]. By 2160&amp;nbsp;BC, rulers in [[Herakleopolis]] controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the [[Intef I|Intef family]], took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055&amp;nbsp;BC the northern Theban forces under [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands and inaugurating a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Kingdom (2134–1690 BC)===

{{Main|Middle Kingdom of Egypt}}

[[File:Egypte louvre 231 visage.jpg|thumb|upright|Amenemhat III, the last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom]]

The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's prosperity and stability, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Mentuhotep II and his [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier [[Amenemhat I]], upon assuming kingship at the beginning of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] around 1985&amp;nbsp;BC, shifted the nation's capital to the city of [[Itjtawy]] located in [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; From Itjtawy, the pharaohs of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted [[land reclamation]] and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in Nubia rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the &quot;[[Walls-of-the-Ruler]]&quot;, to defend against foreign attack.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Having secured military and political security and vast agricultural and mineral wealth, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in expressions of personal piety and what could be called a [[democratization]] of the afterlife, in which all people possessed a soul and could be welcomed into the company of the gods after death.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 179–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw146&quot;/&gt; and the [[relief]] and portrait sculpture of the period captured
subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, [[Amenemhat III]], allowed [[Semitic]] speaking [[Canaan]]ite settlers from the [[Near East]] into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the [[Canaan]]ite settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the [[Hyksos]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Intermediate Period (1674–1549 BC) and the Hyksos===

{{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}}

Around 1785&amp;nbsp;BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a [[Semitic]] [[Canaan]]ite people called the [[Hyksos]] had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of [[Avaris]], seized control of Egypt, and forced the central government to retreat to Thebes, where the pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryholt310&quot;&gt;Ryholt (1997) p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyksos (&quot;foreign rulers&quot;) retained Egyptian models of government and portrayed themselves as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other Semitic invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the [[composite bow]] and the horse-drawn [[chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

After their retreat, the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos' [[Nubian people|Nubian]] allies, the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]], to the south of Egypt. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555&amp;nbsp;BC &lt;ref name=&quot;Ryholt310&quot;/&gt; The pharaohs [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and [[Kamose]] were ultimately able to defeat the [[Nubians]] to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, [[Ahmose I]], who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain mastery of the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egypt NK edit.svg|upright|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of ancient Egypt (15th century BC)]]

===New Kingdom (1549–1069 BC)===

{{Main|New Kingdom}}

The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the [[Mitanni]] Empire, [[Assyria]], and [[Canaan]]. Military campaigns waged under [[Thutmose I|Tuthmosis I]] and his grandson [[Thutmose III|Tuthmosis III]] extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Between their reigns, Hatshepsut generally promoted peace and extended trade routes back to those lost during the Hyksos occupation, as well as venturing to new regions. When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC, Egypt had an empire extending from [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]] in north west [[Syria]] to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in [[Nubia]], cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as [[bronze]] and [[wood]].&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Il tempio di Hatshepsut.JPG|thumb|left|''Djeser-Djeseru'' is the main building of Hatshepsut's [[mortuary temple]] complex at [[Deir el-Bahri]], the building is an example of perfect [[symmetry]] that predates the [[Parthenon]] by a thousand years]]
The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god [[Amun]], whose growing cult was based in [[Karnak]]. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/hatshepsut.html |title=Hatshepsut|accessdate=9 December 2007 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071118100021/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/hatshepsut.html| archivedate= 18 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her reign was very successful, marked by an extended period of peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to [[Land of Punt|Punt]], restoration of foreign trade networks, great building projects including an elegant [[mortuary temple]] that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, Amenhotep II, sought to erase her legacy near the end of his father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.

Around 1350&amp;nbsp;BC, the stability of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to [[Akhenaten]], he touted the previously obscure [[Solar deity|sun deity]] [[Aten]] as the [[God|supreme deity]], suppressed the worship of most other deities and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred (1988) p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day [[Amarna]]), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the [[Near East]] (where the [[Hittites]], [[Mitanni]], and [[Assyrians]] were vying for control) and absorbed himself in his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes, and under their influence the subsequent pharaohs [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ay]], and [[Horemheb]] attempted to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the [[Amarna Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Cline (2001) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFEC EGYPT ABUSIMBEL 2006-003.JPG|thumb|upright|125px|right|Four colossal statues of [[Ramesses II]] flank the entrance of his temple [[Abu Simbel]]]]
Around 1279&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Ramesses II]], also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.&lt;ref&gt;From his two principal wives and large harem, Ramesses II sired more than 100 children. Clayton (1994) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the [[Hittites]] in the [[Battle of Kadesh]] (in modern [[Syria]]) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley (2001) pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; With both the Egyptians and [[Hittite Empire]] proving unable to gain the upper hand over one another, and both powers also fearful of the expanding [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], [[Egypt]] withdraw from much of the [[Near East]]. The [[Hittites]] were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful [[Assyrians]] and the newly arrived [[Phrygians]].

Egypt's wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] to the west, and the [[Sea Peoples]], a powerful confederation of largely [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Luwian]] and [[Phoenicia]]n/[[Caananite]] pirates from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern [[Caanan]], much of it falling to the [[Assyrians]]. The impact of external threats was exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|temple of Amun]] in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Intermediate Period (1069–653 BC)===
{{Main|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}

Following the death of [[Ramesses XI]] in 1078 BC, [[Smendes]] assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]]. The south was effectively controlled by the [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priests of Amun at Thebes]], who recognized Smendes in name only.&lt;ref&gt;Cerny (1975) p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes from what was later to be called [[Libya]] had been settling in the western delta and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under [[Shoshenq I]] in 945 BC, founding the so-called [[Libyan]] Berber, or [[Bubastite]], dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions.

In the mid-ninth century BC, Egypt made a failed attempt to once more gain a foothold in [[Western Asia]]. [[Osorkon II]] of Egypt, along with a large alliance of nations and peoples, including; [[Israel]], [[Hamath]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Caanan]], the [[Arabs]], [[Arameans]], and neo [[Hittites]] among others engaged in the [[Battle of Karkar]] against the powerful [[Assyria]]n king [[Shalmaneser III]] in 853 BC.  However, this coalition of powers failed and the [[Assyrian Empire]] continued to dominate Western Asia.

Libyan Berber control began to erode as a rival native dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]].  Also, the [[Nubians]] of the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]] threatened Egypt from the lands to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, NYU|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piye made various unsuccessful attempts to extend Egyptian influence in the [[Near East]], then controlled by [[Assyria]]. In 720 BC, he sent an army in support a rebellion against Assyria, which was taking place in [[Philistia]] and [[Gaza]].  However, Piye was defeated by [[Sargon II]] and the rebellion failed. In 711 BC, [[Piye]] again supported a revolt against the [[Assyrians]] by the [[Israelites]] of [[Ashdod]] and was once again defeated by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].  Subsequently, [[Piye]] was forced from the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;F Leo Oppenheim - Ancient Mesopotamia&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria fought for control of the southern Levant.  Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aide in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army.  Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East.  Taharqa aided the [[Judean]] King [[Hezekiah]] when Hezekiah and [[Jerusalem]] was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:9;Isaiah 37:9).  Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem.  Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aubin|first=Henry T.|title=The Rescue of Jerusalem|year=2002|publisher=Soho Press, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-56947-275-0|pages=6–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aubin|first=Henry T.|title=The Rescue of Jerusalem|year=2002|publisher=Soho Press, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-56947-275-0|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue that disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city and Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgeRoux&quot;&gt;George Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians began their invasion of Egypt under king [[Esarhaddon]], successor of Sennacherib.  Sennacherib had been murdered by his own sons for destroying the rebellious city of [[Babylon]].   In 674 BC, Taharqa defeated Esarhaddon and the Assyrian army outright on Egyptian soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aubin|first=Henry T.|title=The Rescue of Jerusalem|year=2002|publisher=Soho Press, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-56947-275-0|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 671 BC, Esarhaddon drove the Kushites from Northern Egypt and back to their [[Nubia]]n homeland.  However, the native Egyptian rulers installed by Esarhaddon were unable to retain full control of the whole country for long.  Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt as far north as [[Memphis]]. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa, however he fell ill and died in his capital, [[Nineveh]], before he left Assyria.  His successor, [[Ashurbanipal]], sent a general with a small, but well trained army, which defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.

His successor, [[Tantamani|Tanutamun]], also made a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He successfully defeated [[Necho I|Necho]], the puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. A native ruler, [[Psammetichus I]] was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to pose a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p330-332&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Period (672–332 BC)===
{{Main|Late Period of ancient Egypt|History of Achaemenid Egypt}}

With no permanent plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]]. By 653&amp;nbsp;BC, the Saite king [[Psamtik I]] (taking advantage of the fact that Assyria was involved in a fierce war conquering [[Elam]] and that few Assyrian troops were stationed in Egypt) was able to free Egypt relatively peacefully from  Assyrian vassalage with the help of [[Lydia]]n and [[Greece|Greek]] mercenaries, the latter of whom were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Psamtik and his successors however were careful to maintain peaceful relations with Assyria. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of [[Naucratis|Naukratis]] became the home of Greeks in the delta. In 609 BC [[Necho II]] went to war with [[Babylonia]], the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], the [[Medians]] and the [[Scythians]] in an attempt to save Assyria, which after a brutal internal civil war was being ovverrun by this coalition of powers. However, the attempt to save Egypts former masters failed. The Egyptians delayed intervening too long, and [[Nineveh]] had already fallen and King [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] was dead by the time Necho II sent his armies northwards. However Necho easily brushed aside the [[Israelite]] army under King [[Josiah]] but he and the Assyrians then lost a battle at [[Harran]] to the Babylonians, Medes and Scythians. Necho II and [[Ashur-uballit II]] of Assyria were finally defeated at [[Carchemish]] in [[Aramea]] (modern [[Syria]]) in 605 BC. The Egyptians remained in the area for some decades, struggling with the [[Babylonian]] kings [[Nabopolassar]] and [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] for control of portions of the former Assyrian Empire in [[The Levant]]. However, they were eventually driven back into Egypt, and [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] even briefly invaded [[Egypt]] itself in 567 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgeRoux&quot; /&gt;  The Saite kings based in the new capital of [[Sais]] witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525&amp;nbsp;BC, the powerful [[Persia]]ns, led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the battle of [[Pelusium]]. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of [[Susa]] in Persia (modern [[Iran]]), leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its annexation by [[Persia]], Egypt was joined with [[Cyprus]] and [[Phoenicia]] (modern [[Lebanon]]) in the sixth [[satrap]]y of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-seventh dynasty, ended in 402&amp;nbsp;BC, and from 380–343&amp;nbsp;BC the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt, which ended with the kingship of [[Nectanebo II]]. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the Thirty-first Dynasty, began in 343&amp;nbsp;BC, but shortly after, in 332&amp;nbsp;BC, the Persian ruler [[Mazaces]] handed Egypt over to the [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] ruler [[Alexander the Great]] without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ptolemaic dynasty===
{{Main|History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty}}
In 332 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt with little resistance from the [[Persia]]ns and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Alexandria]]. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a [[Seat of Wisdom|seat of learning]] and culture, centered at the famous [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian gods]] were [[Syncretic religion|syncretized]] into composite deities, such as [[Serapis]], and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful [[Syriac]] opponents from the [[Near East]] made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Period===

{{Main|History of Roman Egypt}}

[[File:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|left|100px|upright|The [[Fayum mummy portraits]] epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures.]]

Egypt became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, following the defeat of [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] by [[Augustus|Octavian]] (later [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] Augustus) in the [[Battle of Actium]]. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the [[Roman legion|Roman army]], under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw422&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some of the Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw422&quot;/&gt;

From the mid-first century AD, [[Christianity]] took root in Egypt as it was seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian Religion]] and [[Greco-Roman]] religion and threatened the popular religious traditions. This led to persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of [[Diocletian]] starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2003) p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; In 391 the Christian Emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Church in Ancient Society''&quot;, [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], p. 373, Oxford University Press US, 2001, ISBN 0-19-924695-5&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D 100–400&quot;'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]], p. 63, Yale University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-300-03216-1&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak [[Egyptian language|their language]], the ability to read [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to [[church (building)|church]]es or abandoned to the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth century AD, the [[Roman Empire]] split into two, and Egypt became part of the Eastern Empire, known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Eastern Empire became increasingly &quot;oriental&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; in style, as its links with the old [[Greco-Roman]] world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared.

The [[Sassanid]] [[Persian people|Persians]] who were involved in a long running and draining war with [[Byzantium]] for control of the [[Near East]], [[Asia Minor]], [[North Africa]] and the east [[Mediterranean]], briefly recaptured Egypt under King [[Khosrow II]] in 618 AD, but were ejected by the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] in 628 AD.

===Arab Muslim Period===
An army of 4,000 [[Arabs]] led by [[Amr Ibn Al-Aas]] was sent by the [[Caliph Umar]], successor to Muhammad, to spread [[Islamic]] rule to the west. The [[Arabs]] crossed into Egypt from [[Palestine]] in December 639 AD, and advanced rapidly into the Nile Delta. The Imperial garrisons, exhausted by constant war with the [[Persia]]ns, retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more. But the Arabs sent for reinforcements, and in April 641 they captured Alexandria. The Byzantines did assemble a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt, and won back Alexandria in 645, but the Muslims retook the city in 646, completing the Arab Muslim conquest of Egypt. Thus ended 975 years of Græco-Roman rule over Egypt.

Local resistance by the native Egyptian [[Copts]] however, began to materialize shortly thereafter and would last until at least the ninth century. The Arabs imposed a special tax, known as [[Jizya]], on the Egyptians, who were by this time [[Coptic Christians]]. They acquired the status of [[dhimmis]], and all native Egyptians were prohibited from joining the army. The Arabs in the seventh century used the term ''quft'' to describe the indigenous people of Egypt. Thus, Egyptians became known as [[Copts]], and the non-Chalcedonian [[Egyptian Church]] became known as the [[Coptic Church]]. The indigenous population of Egypt was gradually and largely ''Arabized'' and ''Islamicized'' over the following centuries, However, native Egyptian identity and language survived among the Copts, who spoke the Coptic language, a direct descendant of the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] Egyptian (which itself was an evolution of [[Ancient Egyptian]]) spoken in the Roman era. Since the eighteenth century, Coptic has mostly been limited to liturgical use and today Coptic is extinct as a primary language. Copts still to this day espouse an [[Egypt]]ian rather than [[Arab]] ethnic identity.

==Government and economy==

===Administration and commerce===

[[File:Pharaoh.svg|thumb|upright|The pharaoh was usually depicted wearing symbols of royalty and power.|150px]]

The [[pharaoh]] was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme [[Commander|military commander]] and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] each governed by a [[nomarch]], who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The [[Egyptian temple|temples]] formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nation's wealth in a system of [[granary|granaries]] and treasuries administered by [[Supervisor|overseer]]s, who redistributed grain and goods.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use [[Currency|coinage]] until the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late period]], they did use a type of money-barter system,&lt;ref&gt;Meskell (2004) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; with standard sacks of grain and the ''[[Deben (unit)|deben]]'', a weight of roughly {{convert|91|g|oz|0}} of copper or silver, forming a common denominator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian372&quot;&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5½&amp;nbsp;sacks (200&amp;nbsp;kg or 400&amp;nbsp;lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn 7½&amp;nbsp;sacks (250&amp;nbsp;kg or 550&amp;nbsp;lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140&amp;nbsp;deben.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian372&quot;/&gt; Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian372&quot;/&gt; During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of [[precious metal]] rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Walbank (1984) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social status===
Egyptian society was highly stratified, and [[social status]] was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or [[Nobility|noble family]] that owned the land.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a [[corvée]] system.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, the so-called &quot;white kilt class&quot; in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.&lt;ref&gt;Billard (1978) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. [[Slavery]] was known in ancient Egypt, but the extent and prevalence of its practice are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/social/index.html |title=Social classes in ancient Egypt |accessdate=11 December 2007 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213192904/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/social/index.html| archivedate= 13 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes except slaves, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest [[peasant]] was entitled to petition the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] and his court for redress.&lt;ref name=UCJohnson/&gt; Although, slaves were mostly used as indentured servants. They were able to buy and sell, or work their way to freedom or nobility, and usually were treated by [[physician|doctor]]s in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/slavery.htm Slavery in Ancient Egypt]&lt;/span&gt;from http://www.reshafim.org.il. Retrieved August 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Cleopatra VI]] even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as [[God's Wife of Amun|Divine Wives of Amun]]. Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, served only secondary roles in the temples, and were not as likely to be as educated as men.&lt;ref name=UCJohnson/&gt; &lt;!--- Moved reference about women and gender equality down to External Links -RoyGoldsmith, 4/9/12 ---&gt;

[[File:Louvre-antiquites-egyptiennes-p1020372 Cropped and bg reduced.png|thumb|left|upright|Scribes were elite and well educated. They assessed taxes, kept records, and were responsible for administration.]]

===Legal system===
The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;/&gt; Although no [[legal code]]s from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCJohnson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777190170/|title=Women's Legal Rights in Ancient Egypt|accessdate=31 August 2010|publisher=University of Chicago, 2004| author=Janet H. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local councils of elders, known as ''Kenbet'' in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;/&gt; More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the ''Great Kenbet'', over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes (2003) p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;/&gt; Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[oracle]]s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an [[ostracon]].&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (1999) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

[[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields, harvesting the crops, and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer, painting in the tomb of [[TT52|Nakht]].]]

A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich [[fertile soil]] resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''Akhet'' (flooding), ''Peret'' (planting), and ''Shemu'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain. [[Winnowing]] removed the [[chaff]] from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians cultivated [[emmer]] and [[barley]], and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flax]] plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food.]]

====Animals====

The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal117&quot;&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Animals, both [[Domestication|domesticated]] and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry such as ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian381&quot;&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and they provided both honey and wax.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and [[oxen]] as [[Working animal|beasts of burden]], and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian381&quot;/&gt; Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, and the camel, although known from the New Kingdom, was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that [[elephant]]s were briefly utilized in the Late Period, but largely abandoned due to lack of [[grazing]] land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian381&quot;/&gt; Dogs, cats and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as lions, were reserved for royalty. [[Herodotus]] observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal117&quot;/&gt; During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]] and the ibis god [[Thoth]], and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes (2003) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
{{Further|Mining industry of Egypt}}
Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These [[natural resource]]s allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and [[fashion jewelry]].&lt;ref&gt;Greaves (1929) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embalming|Embalmers]] used salts from the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] for [[mummy|mummification]], which also provided the [[gypsum]] needed to make plaster.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas (1962) p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; Ore-bearing [[rock formation]]s were found in distant, inhospitable [[wadi]]s in the [[Arabian Desert|eastern desert]] and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive [[Gold mining|gold mines]] in [[Nubia]], and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The [[Wadi Hammamat]] was a notable source of granite, [[greywacke]], and gold. [[Flint]] was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as [[sulfur]] as cosmetic substances.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulfur?topic=49557 ''Sulfur''. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A. Jorgensen and C.J. Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians worked deposits of the [[Lead|lead ore]] [[galena]] at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from [[malachite]] ore mined in the Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;Scheel (1989) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in [[Alluvium|alluvial deposits]], or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], greywacke, [[alabaster]], and [[carnelian]] dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of [[emerald]]s in Wadi Sikait and [[amethyst]] in Wadi el-Hudi.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian trade}}
[[File:Relief of Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt by Σταύρος.jpg|thumb|Hatshepsut's trading expedition to the [[Land of Punt]].]]
The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their [[Foreign contacts of ancient Egypt|foreign neighbors]] to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]], they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; An Egyptian [[colony]] stationed in southern [[Canaan]] dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Porat and Edwin van den Brink (editor), &quot;An Egyptian Colony in Southern Palestine During the Late Predynastic to Early Dynastic,&quot; in ''The Nile Delta in Transition: 4th to 3rd Millennium BC'' (1992), pp. 433–440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narmer]] had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Naomi&quot;&gt;Naomi Porat, &quot;Local Industry of Egyptian Pottery in Southern Palestine During the Early Bronze I Period,&quot; in ''Bulletin of the Egyptological, Seminar 8'' (1986/1987), pp. 109–129. See also [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/1stdynegyppotsinpalestine.html University College London web post, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian trade with [[Byblos]] yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt relied on trade with [[Anatolia]] for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone [[lapis lazuli]], which had to be imported from far-away [[Afghanistan]]. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of [[olive oil]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1990) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical development===

{{Hiero | ''r n kmt''&lt;br /&gt; 'Egyptian language' | &lt;hiero&gt;r:Z1 n km m t:O49&lt;/hiero&gt; | align=right | era=default}}

The [[Egyptian language]] is a northern [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language closely related to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Semitic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137&lt;/ref&gt; It has the second longest history of any language (after [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]), having been written from c. 3200&amp;nbsp;BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are [[Old Egyptian]], [[Middle Egyptian]] (Classical Egyptian), [[Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian was a [[synthetic language]], but it became more [[Analytic language|analytic]] later on. Late Egyptian develops prefixal definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|articles]], which replace the older inflectional [[suffix]]es. There is a change from the older [[verb–subject–object]] [[word order]] to [[subject–verb–object]].&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137-38&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], [[hieratic]], and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic [[Coptic alphabet]]. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Orthodox Church]], and traces of it are found in modern [[Egyptian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Vittman (1991) pp. 197–227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sounds and grammar===

Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]] consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and voiced and voiceless [[Affricate consonant|affricates]]. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Later Egyptian to about nine.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995a) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a [[Semitic root|triliteral]] or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the [[Grammatical person|person]]. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton '''{{transl|egy|S-Ḏ-M}}''' is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is ''{{transl|egy|sḏm}}'', 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995a) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{transl|egy|sḏm ḥmt}}'', 'the woman hears'.

Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call ''[[Arabic grammar|nisba]]tion'' because of its similarity with Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The word order is {{smallcaps|predicate–subject}} in verbal and adjectival sentences, and {{smallcaps|subject–predicate}} in nominal and adverbial sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) pp. 67, 70, 109&lt;/ref&gt; The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2005) p. 2147&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs and nouns are negated by the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''n'', but ''nn'' is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===

{{Main|Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieratic}}

[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Rosetta Stone|Rosetta stone]] (ca 196 BC) enabled linguists to begin the process of hieroglyph decipherment.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphic writing]] dates from c. 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called [[hieratic]], which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995a) pp. 10–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified [[Greek alphabet]] with the addition of some Demotic signs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and Islamic periods in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly (2005) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{Main|Ancient Egyptian literature}}

[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith surgical papyrus]] (c. 16th century BC) describes anatomy and medical treatments and is written in hieratic.]]

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the ''Per Ankh'' institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.&lt;ref&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the [[Pyramid Texts|Pyramid]] and [[Coffin Texts]], were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300&amp;nbsp;BC. Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside]] administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of [[Harkhuf]] and [[Weni the Elder|Weni]]. The genre known as ''[[Sebayt]]'' (&quot;instructions&quot;) was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the [[Ipuwer Papyrus|Ipuwer papyrus]], a poem of lamentations describing [[natural disaster]]s and social upheaval, is a famous example.

The [[Story of Sinuhe]], written in [[Middle Egyptian]], might be the classic of Egyptian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim (1975) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Also written at this time was the [[Westcar Papyrus]], a set of stories told to [[Khufu]] by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim (1975) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Instruction of Amenemope]] is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Wisdom in Ancient Israel&quot;'', John Day,/John Adney Emerton,/Robert P. Gordon/ Hugh Godfrey/Maturin Williamson, p23, Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-521-62489-4&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the [[Late Egyptian|vernacular language]] was more often employed to write popular pieces like the [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instruction of Any]]. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the [[Greco-Roman|Graeco-Roman]] period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim (1980) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of [[Mudbrick|mud-brick]] designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from [[animal fat]] and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and [[Beauty and Cosmetics in Ancient Egypt|cosmetics]]. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's [[income]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 406–7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ägyptischer Maler um 1400 v. Chr. 001.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient Egyptians maintained a rich cultural heritage complete with feasts and festivals accompanied by music and dance.]]
Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported [[lute]]s and [[lyre]]s from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/furniture/music.html|title=Music in Ancient Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080328000007/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/furniture/music.html| archivedate= 28 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sistrum]] was a rattle-like [[musical instrument]] that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. [[Senet]], a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was [[mehen (game)|mehen]], which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and [[ball game]]s were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at [[Beni Hasan]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers' village of [[Deir el-Madinah]] has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community were studied in such detail.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Cambridge Ancient History: II Part I , The Middle East and the Aegean Region, c.1800-13380 B.C&quot;'', Edited I.E.S Edwards–C.JGadd–N.G.L Hammond-E.Sollberger, Cambridge at the University Press, p. 380, 1973, ISBN 0-521-08230-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
&lt;!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' --&gt;
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian cuisine}}
Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed, the [[Egyptian cuisine|cuisine of modern Egypt]] retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 399–400&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:S F-E-CAMERON EGYPT 2006 FEB 00289.JPG|thumb|The well preserved [[Temple of Edfu|Temple of Horus at Edfu]] is an exemplar of Egyptian architecture.]]
The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Karnak|temples at Thebes]]. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large [[stone structures]] with accuracy and precision.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) pp. 94–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in [[Malkata]] and [[Amarna]], show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;Badawy (1968) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, [[Djoser]]'s mortuary complex, include [[post and lintel]] supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.

The earliest preserved ancient [[Egyptian temples]], such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]], the open courtyard, and the enclosed [[hypostyle]] hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Graeco-Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/temple/typestime.html|title=Types of temples in ancient Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080319233620/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/temple/typestime.html| archivedate= 19 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the [[mastaba]], a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground [[Chamber tomb|burial chamber]]. The [[step pyramid]] of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (1991) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  The Twenty-fifth dynasty was a notable exception, as all Twenty-fifth dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mokhtar1990&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Emberling2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman1997&quot; /&gt;

{{Main|Art of ancient Egypt}}
The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500&amp;nbsp;years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The [[Narmer Palette]], for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (2001) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone to carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with [[gum arabic]] as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharaohs used [[relief]]s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of [[funerary art]], such as [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;&gt;James (2005) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style frescoes were found in [[Avaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to [[Akhenaten]]'s revolutionary religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; This style, known as [[Amarna art]], was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
&lt;!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' --&gt;

{{Main|Ancient Egyptian religion}}

[[File:BD Hunefer.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Book of the Dead]] was a guide to the deceased's journey in the afterlife.]]

Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Egyptian mythology|myths]] and stories into a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology''&quot;, edited by [[Donald B. Redford]], p. 106, Berkley, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Ka statue]] provided a physical place for the Ka to manifest.]]

Gods were worshiped in cult [[Egyptian temple|temples]] administered by priests acting on the king's behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw313&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''šwt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) pp. 79, 94–5&lt;/ref&gt; The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the &quot;blessed dead&quot;, living on as an ''akh'', or &quot;effective one&quot;. For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a &quot;feather of truth&quot;. If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, ''et al.'' (1994) pp. 150–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial customs===
&lt;!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' --&gt;
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}
The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by [[Mummy|mummification]], performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;/&gt; Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by [[desiccation]]. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in [[canopic jar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/ok.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Old Kingdom|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anubis attending the mummy of Sennedjem.jpg|thumb|left|Anubis was the ancient Egyptian god associated with mummification and burial rituals; here, he attends to a mummy.]]

By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70&amp;nbsp;days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called [[natron]]. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Late Period, Ptolemaic, Roman and Christian Period |accessdate=9 March 2008 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080330041612/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html| archivedate= 30 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[Book of the Dead|books of the dead]] were included in the grave, along with [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/shabtis.html|title=Shabtis|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080324044813/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/shabtis.html| archivedate= 24 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Military of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egyptian-Chariot.png|thumb|right|An Egyptian [[chariot]].]]
The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the [[ancient Near East]]. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of [[Buhen]] on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the [[Levant]]. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and parts of the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical military equipment included [[Bow (weapon)|bows and arrows]], spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching [[Leather|animal skin]] over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using [[Chariotry in ancient Egypt|chariots]] that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the [[Khopesh]] was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 366–67&lt;/ref&gt; The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army, it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and his sons, did do so.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; although it has also been argued that &quot;kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Garry J.|title=The Death of King Seqenenre Tao|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|year=2009|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology, medicine, and mathematics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Civilization]] --&gt;

===Technology===
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian technology}}
In technology, medicine and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional [[empiricism]], as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers Papyrus|Ebers papyri]] (c. 1600&amp;nbsp;BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and [[decimal|decimal system]].
[[File:Egyptian glass jar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassmaking was a highly developed art.]]

===Faience and glass===
Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as [[Egyptian faience|faience]], which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], small amounts of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] and [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and a colorant, typically copper.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as [[Egyptian blue|Egyptian Blue]], also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or [[sintering]]) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding [[Micromineral|trace elements]] to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}
[[File:Ancient Egyptian medical instruments.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the temple at Kom Ombo.]]
The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from [[malaria]] and debilitating [[schistosomiasis]] parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to [[abscess]]es (though [[dental caries|caries]] were rare).&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted [[Periodontitis|periodontal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Adult [[life expectancy]] was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Figures are given for ''adult'' life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy ''at birth.'' Filer (1995) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, such as [[Imhotep]], remained famous long after their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.&lt;ref&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Training of physicians took place at the ''Per Ankh'' or &quot;House of Life&quot; institution, most notably those headquartered in [[Bubastis|Per-Bastet]] during the New Kingdom and at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] and [[Sais, Egypt|Saïs]] in the Late period. [[Medical papyri]] show [[Empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Stroual (1989) pp. 244–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,&lt;ref&gt;Stroual (1989) p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; while [[opium]] was used to relieve pain. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve [[asthma]] symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set [[broken bones]], and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shipbuilding===
Early [[Egyptians]] knew how to assemble planks of wood into a [[hull (ship)|ship hull]] and had mastered advanced forms of [[shipbuilding]] as early as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC. The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] reports that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the [[Ancient Egyptian Boats (First Dynasty) - Abydos|Abydos boats]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;&gt;Ward, Cheryl. &quot;[http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html World's Oldest Planked Boats]&quot;, in''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). Archaeological Institute of America.&lt;/ref&gt; These are a group of 14 discovered ships in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] that were constructed of wooden planks &quot;sewn&quot; together. Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of [[New York University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot;&gt;Schuster, Angela M.H. &quot;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/abydos.html This Old Boat]&quot;, 11 December 2000. Archaeological Institute of America.&lt;/ref&gt; woven [[strap]]s were found to have been used to lash the planks together,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt; and [[Cyperus papyrus|reeds]] or [[grass]] stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt; Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to [[Khasekhemwy|Pharaoh Khasekhemwy]], originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating. The ship dating to 3000&amp;nbsp;BC was {{convert|75|ft|m}} long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh. According to professor O'Connor, the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to [[Hor-Aha|Pharaoh Aha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot;/&gt;

Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with [[treenail]]s to fasten them together, using [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[caulking]] the seams. The &quot;[[Khufu ship]]&quot;, a 43.6-meter vessel sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a [[solar barque]]. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with [[mortise and tenon]] joints.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot; /&gt; Despite the ancient Egyptian's ability to construct very large boats to sail along the easily navigable Nile, they were not known as good sailors and did not engage in widespread sailing or shipping in the Mediterranean or Red Seas.

===Mathematics===

{{Main|Egyptian mathematics}}

[[File:Senenmut-Grab.JPG|right|thumb|[[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|Astronomical chart in Senemut's tomb]], [[18th dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;Full version at [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/100000870#fullscreen Met Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic [[Naqada]] period, and show a fully developed [[numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;Understanding of Egyptian mathematics is incomplete due to paucity of available material and lack of exhaustive study of the texts that have been uncovered. Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain.&lt;ref&gt;Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], and could solve simple sets of [[simultaneous equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hiero | {{frac|2|3}} | &lt;hiero&gt;D22&lt;/hiero&gt;| align=right| era=default}}

[[Mathematical notation]] was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write [[Egyptian fraction|fractions]] as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction ''two-fifths'' into the sum of ''one-third'' + ''one-fifteenth''. Standard tables of values facilitated this.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Vulgar fraction|common fractions]], however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner (1957) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had a grasp of the principles underlying the [[Pythagorean theorem]], knowing, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the [[hypotenuse]] when its sides were in a 3–4–5 ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal241&quot;&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to estimate the area of a [[circle]] by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:

:Area ≈ [({{frac|8|9}})''D'']&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ({{frac|256|81}})''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3.16''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

a reasonable approximation of the formula '''[[Pi|π]]'''''''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[golden ratio]] seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (1989) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess [[Isis]], for example, became popular in the [[Roman Empire]], as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans also imported [[building material]]s from Egypt to erect Egyptian style structures. Early historians such as [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later [[Islam]], but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[al-Maqrizi]].&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly (2005) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of [[Egyptomania]] across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the European [[colonialism|colonial]] occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners had more positive results. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], for example, arranged the first studies in [[Egyptology]] when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's [[natural history]], which was published in the ''[[Description de l'Égypte|Description de l'Ėgypte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.

'''Analog Brothers''' is an experimental hip-hop crew featuring Ice Oscillator also known as [[Ice-T]] (keyboards, drums, vocals), Keith Korg also known as [[Kool Keith]] (bass, strings, vocals), Mark Moog also known as Marc Live (drums, ''violyns'' and vocals), Silver Synth also known as Black Silver (synthesizer, lazar bell and vocals), and Rex Roland also known as Pimp Rex (keyboards, vocals, production). Its album ''Pimp to Eat'' featured guest appearances by various members of [[Rhyme Syndicate]], [[Odd Oberheim]], [[Jacky jasper]] (who appears as Jacky Jasper on the song &quot;We Sleep Days&quot; and H-Bomb on &quot;War&quot;), D.J. Cisco from S.M., the [[Synth-a-Size Sisters]] and Teflon.

While the group only recorded one album together as the Analog Brothers, a few bootlegs of its live concert performances, including freestyles with original lyrics, have occasionally surfaced online. After ''Pimp to Eat'', the Analog Brothers continued performing together in various line ups. [[Kool Keith]] and Marc Live joined with [[Jacky jasper]] to release two albums as KHM. Marc Live rapped with Ice T's group SMG. Marc also formed a group with Black Silver called Live Black, but while five of their tracks were released on a demo CD sold at concerts, Live Black's first album has yet to be released.

In 2008, [[Ice-T]] and Black Silver toured together as Black Ice, and released an album together called [[Urban Legends (Black Ice)|Urban Legends]].

In addition to all this, the Analog Brothers continue to make frequent appearances on each other's solo albums.

The '''motor neuron diseases''' ('''MND''') are a group of [[neurological disorder]]s that selectively affect [[motor neuron]]s, the cells that control voluntary muscle activity including speaking, walking, swallowing, and general movement of the body. They are generally progressive in nature, and cause increasingly debilitating disability and, eventually, death.

==Terminology==
Terms used to describe the motor neuron diseases can be confusing. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''motor neurone disease'' (sometimes spelt as ''motor neuron disease'') refers both to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and to the broader spectrum of related motor neuron disorders that includes [[progressive muscular atrophy]], [[primary lateral sclerosis]], and [[progressive bulbar palsy]]. In the [[United States]], ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (ALS) is commonly used both for the specific disorder [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (frequently referred to there as ''Lou Gehrig's disease'') and as a [[blanket term]] for the entire spectrum of MND.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm |title=Motor Neuron Diseases Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |publisher=www.ninds.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid confusion, the annual scientific research conference dedicated to the study of MND is called the &quot;International ALS/MND Symposium&quot;.

Although MND refers to a specific subset of pathologically similar diseases, there are numerous other afflictions of [[motor neuron]]s that are pathologically distinct from MND, have a different clinical course and should not be confused with MND, such as [[spinal muscular atrophy]], [[spinobulbar muscular atrophy]], [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]], and many others.

==Classification==
In the most common classification, the term &quot;motor neuron disease&quot; applies to the following five disorders which affect either [[upper motor neuron]]s (UMN) or [[lower motor neuron]]s (LMN), or both:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 ! Type 
 ! UMN degeneration
 ! LMN degeneration 
 |- 
 | [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) || yes || yes 
 |- 
 | [[Primary lateral sclerosis]] (PLS) || yes || no
 |- 
 | [[Progressive muscular atrophy]] (PMA) || no || yes 
 |- 
 | [[Progressive bulbar palsy]] (PBP) || no || yes – [[bulbar]] region
 |- 
 | [[Pseudobulbar palsy]] || yes – bulbar region  || no
|}

Even though diseases known as [[spinal muscular atrophies]], including the most common [[spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA), affect motor neurons and are classified as MND by the disease terminology classification system [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH), they are not classified as such by the [[ICD-10|tenth International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) published in 1992 and thus are not discussed in this article.

{{For|the traditional ordering of the letters of the Arabic alphabet|Abjad numerals}}
{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}

An '''abjad''' is a type of [[writing system]] where each symbol always or usually&lt;ref name=omniglot/&gt; stands for a [[consonant]], leaving the reader to supply the appropriate [[vowel]].
It is a term suggested by [[Peter T. Daniels]]&lt;ref name=Dan/&gt; to replace the common terms &quot;'''consonantary'''&quot;, &quot;'''consonantal alphabet'''&quot; or &quot;[[syllabary]]&quot; to refer to the family of scripts called [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]]. Abjad is thought to be based on the first letters (a,b,ǧ,d) found in all Semitic language such as [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Syriac]], [[Hebrew]], and [[Arabic]]. In Arabic, &quot;A&quot; ({{transl|ar|DIN|ʾAlif}}), &quot;B&quot; ({{transl|ar|DIN|Bāʾ}}), &quot;{{unicode|Ǧ}}&quot; ({{transl|ar|DIN|Ǧīm}}), &quot;D&quot; ({{transl|ar|DIN|Dāl}}) make the word &quot;abjad&quot; which means &quot;alphabet&quot;. The modern Arabic word for &quot;alphabet&quot; and &quot;abjad&quot; is interchangeably either &quot;abajadeyyah&quot; or &quot;alefbaaeyyah&quot;. The word &quot;alphabet&quot; in English has a source in Greek language in which the first two letters were &quot;A&quot; (alpha) and &quot;B&quot; (beta), hence &quot;alphabeta&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;alfabeto&quot;, but also called &quot;abecedario&quot;, from &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot;). In Hebrew the first two letters are &quot;A&quot; (Aleph), &quot;B&quot; (Bet) hence &quot;alephbet.&quot; It is also used to enumerate a list in the same manner that &quot;a, b, c, d&quot; (etc.) are used in the English language.

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

==Etymology==
The name &quot;abjad&quot; (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabǧad}}'' {{lang|ar|أبجد}}) is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the ''Arabic'' alphabet in order. The ordering (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabǧadī }}'') of [[Arabic letters]] used to match that of the older [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Semitic alphabet|Semitic]] alphabets; ''{{transl|sem|ʾ b g d}}'' (read [[right-to-left|from right to left]]: {{lang|ar|أ ب ج د}}) or {{lang|ar|أبجد}}.

==Terminology==
According to the formulations of Daniels,&lt;ref name=Dan/&gt; abjads differ from [[alphabet]]s in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic [[grapheme]]s. Abjads differ from [[abugida]]s, another category invented by Daniels, in that in abjads, the vowel sound is ''implied'' by [[phonology]], and where [[Diacritic|vowel marks]] exist for the system, such as [[niqqud|nikkud]] for [[Hebrew]] and [[harakat|harakāt]] for [[Arabic]], their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas mark the vowels (other than the &quot;inherent&quot; vowel) with a [[diacritic]], a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone [[glyph]]. Some abugidas use a special symbol to ''suppress'' the [[inherent vowel]] so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a [[syllabary]], a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.

The antagonism of abjad versus alphabet has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term for the Arabic numeral system. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to for instance the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard G. Lehmann: &quot;27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic&quot;, in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52, esp. p. 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:Ba`alat.png|thumb|upright=1.10|A specimen of Proto-Sinaitic script containing a phrase which may mean 'to Baalat'. The line running from the upper left to lower right reads ''mt l b&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;lt''.]]

{{See also|History of the alphabet#Descendants of the Aramaic abjad}}
All known abjads belong to the [[Semitic alphabets|Semitic family of scripts]]. These scripts are thought to derive from the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets#Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic alphabet]] (dated to about 1500 BC), which is thought to derive from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The abjad was significantly simpler than the earlier hieroglyphs. The number of distinct glyphs was reduced tremendously at the cost of increased ambiguity.

The first abjad to gain widespread usage was the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician abjad]]. Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] and Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Phoenician script consisted of only about two dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and Phoenician seafaring merchants took the script wherever they went. Phoenician gave way to a number of new writing systems, including the [[Greek alphabet]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], a widely used abjad. The Greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic]], while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.

Aramaic spread across Asia, reaching as far as India and becoming [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]], the ancestral abugida to most modern Indian and Southeast Asian scripts{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. In the Middle East, Aramaic gave rise to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] abjads, which retained many of the Aramaic letter forms{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]] was a cursive variation of Aramaic. It is unclear whether the Arabic abjad was derived from Nabatean or Syriac.

==Impure abjads==
[[Image:Arabic albayancalligraphy.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|&quot;Al-'Arabiyya&quot;, lit. &quot;Arabic.&quot; An example of the Arabic script, which is an impure abjad.]]

&quot;Impure&quot; abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term &quot;pure&quot; abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators. However, most modern abjads, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] and [[Avestan alphabet|Avestan]], are &quot;impure&quot; abjads, that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes. An example of a &quot;pure&quot; abjad is ancient [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]].

===Addition of vowels===
{{Main|Greek alphabet}}

In the 9th century BC, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when the vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the [[guttural consonant|guttural]] sounds represented by [[aleph]], [[he (letter)|he]], [[Heth (letter)|heth]] or [[ayin]], so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[Yodh|yod]] were also used. The Greek alphabet thus became the world's first &quot;true&quot; alphabet.

[[Abugida]]s developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent &quot;a&quot; vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the [[South Arabian alphabet]] evolved into the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, around the 3rd century BC, the [[Brāhmī script]] developed (from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic abjad]], it has been hypothesized).

The other major family of abugidas, [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], was initially developed in the 1840s by missionary and linguist [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] for the Cree and Ojibwe languages. Evans used features of [[Devanagari script]] and [[Pitman shorthand]] to create his initial abugida. Later in the 19th century, other missionaries adapted Evans' system to other Canadian aboriginal languages. Canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol, with each vowel having a consistent orientation.

==Abjads and the structure of Semitic languages==
The abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write.  This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from [[triliteral|a root consisting of (usually) three consonants]], the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms.  For instance, according to [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], the Arabic root {{lang|ar|ذ ب ح}} ''{{unicode|Ḏ-B-Ḥ}}'' (to sacrifice) can be derived the forms {{lang|ar|ذَبَح}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḏabaḥa}}'' (he sacrificed), {{lang|ar|ذَبَحْتَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḏabaḥta}}'' (you (masculine singular) sacrificed), {{lang|ar|ذَبَّحَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḏabbaḥa}}'' (he slaughtered), {{lang|ar|يُذَبِّح}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yuḏabbiḥ}}'' (he slaughters), and {{lang|ar|مَذْبَح}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏbaḥ}}'' (slaughterhouse). In each case, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, improving word recognition{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}{{dubious|date=August 2011}} while reading.&lt;!--extremely exaggerated, there are dozens of Arabic words of different roots which are only distinguished by vowels--&gt;
